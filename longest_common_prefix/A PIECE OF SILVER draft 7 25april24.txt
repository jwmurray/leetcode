FADE UP: 

EXT. SAMARIA, ROAD TO BETHLEHEM - DAY 

Dusty. Dry. Hot. DANIEL, 10 yrs old, innocent, with a mop of  
unruly dark hair gathers stones. He puts two or three stones  
in his satchel. His face is tear streaked; expression, numb. 

EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM, CAMPSITE - DAY 

Daniel adds the stones from his satchel to a growing stack. A  
blanket protrudes from under the stones.  

Daniel places the last stone and sits quietly beside the  
cairn. He clutches a thin leather cord. On it is strung a  
simple ring of silver. 

Stunned, Daniel raises his tear-stained face. 

FLASHBACK 

EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM - DAY 

Daniel and his mother, LEAH, 30’s, slight, make their way  
along the well-worn roadway.  

Leah carries the majority of their burden; a satchel with  
food, a water skin, and a bed roll. Daniel carries a bedroll  
slung across his shoulder and a smaller satchel.  

                     DANIEL 
           When will we be there?  

                     LEAH 
           We still have a ways to go. Have a  
           drink.  

She hands Daniel the water skin. As he drinks, Leah squeezes  
the water skin. Water sprays Daniel. Leah laughs and Daniel  
chases after her.  

EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM - SUNSET 

Daniel holds his mother’s hand as they travel in the last  
rays of the sun.  

Leah smiles and begins a song. Daniel joins in. She puts her  
arm around him.

                                                                     22.. 

              DANIEL                                  LEAH 
(singing)                              (singing) 

EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM, CAMPSITE - NIGHT 

Leah and Daniel sit close to a burning fire. In the distance,  
other fires burn and large groups of TRAVELERS laugh, eat,  
and sing.  

Leah and Daniel finish eating a meal of lentils, dried fish,  
figs, and flat bread.  

                         DANIEL 
            How come we are so far from the  
            other camps? 

                         LEAH 
             It’s hard to know how others will  
            react to sharing the road with two  
             Samaritans. Best to not test them.  

                         DANIEL 
            When we get to Bethlehem, will it  
            be the same? 

Leah gives him a strained smile.  

                         LEAH 
            Yes.  

                         DANIEL 
            Why do we have to be Samaritans? 

                         LEAH 
            Because that is the lot God gave  
            us. We are God’s children. In fact,  
            His chosen.  

                         DANIEL 
             I wish he’d choose someone else. 

Leah laughs.  

                         LEAH 
            Here.  

Leah removes from her neck the same simple silver ring seen  
in Daniel’s hand before the flashback. She puts it around  
Daniel’s neck.  

                         LEAH (CONT’D) 
            Take this.  

------------------4---------------

                                                                     33.. 

                         DANIEL 
            Your ring... 

                         LEAH 
             That silver didn’t magically appear  
             smooth, shiny; beautiful. It took  
             hard work. Sacrifice. The smelter’s  
             furnace. The pounding of the  
            mallet. Only after all that  
             difficulty is it of value. 

Leah hugs him.  

                         LEAH (CONT’D) 
             God is making you a polished piece  
             of silver.  

Daniel looks at the ring with new appreciation. 

                         LEAH (CONT’D) 
             Come. Get your blanket. Time to  
             sleep. 

Daniel gets his bed roll. He kneels facing her 

They cover their eyes with a hand and repeat the Shema. 

              DANIEL                                  LEAH (CONT’D) 
Hear, O Israel,: The Lord,             Hear, O Israel,: The Lord,  
our God, the Lord is one)              our God, the Lord is one) 
    (whispered)                           (whispered) 
Blessed is the name of His             Blessed is the name of His  
glorious kingdom for eternity          glorious kingdom for eternity 
    (aloud)                               (aloud) 
You shall love the Lord your           You shall love the Lord your  
God with all your heart and            God with all your heart and  
with all your soul and with            with all your soul and with  
all your might...                      all your might... 

EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM, CAMPSITE - LATER 

Leah and Daniel sleep around the glow of the remaining coals  
of their fire. Other campfires wink faintly in the distance. 

EXT. CAMPSITE, DISTANT POV - SAME 

Three, disheveled BANDITS watch the sleeping mother and  
child. They move towards them.  

------------------5---------------

                                                                     44.. 

EXT. CAMPSITE - MOMENTS LATER 

Daniel sleeps. Leah stirs.  

Violently, the Bandits grab Leah. Startled, and confused, she  
screams! 

                         LEAH 
            Daniel! 

Daniel awakes with a start. 

Leah struggles in a vain effort with the evil men.  

                         DANIEL 
            Mother! 

                         LEAH 
            Daniel!! Run!! Run!!! 

Daniel doesn’t know whether to fight or run. 

                         LEAH (CONT’D) 
            RUUUUNNN !!!!!! 

One of the Bandits hits Leah across the face with a brutal  
blow. Another Bandit lunges toward Daniel. 

Terrified, Daniel kicks, bites, and screams.  

                         LEAH (CONT’D) 
            Run, Daniel! 

Barely escaping, the petrified boy scrambles into the night. 

END FLASHBACK 

EXT. ROAD TO BETHLEHEM, CAMPSITE - DAY 

Daniel sits next to the cairn that covers his poor mother. We  
now recognize the blanket seen from under the rocks as  
Leah’s. Daniel shakes the horrific memory from his mind.  

EXT. SAMARIA, ROAD TO BETHLEHEM - DAY 

With a dusty tear-streaked face, Daniel walks down the road.  
Behind him, his mother’s rocky grave slowly fades behind him. 

------------------6---------------

                                                                     55.. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM OUTSKIRTS - DAY 

MERCHANTS, VILLAGERS, RABBIS; a bustling crowd comes and goes  
through the entrance to the village of Bethlehem. Daniel is  
overwhelmed by the noise and commotion.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM MARKET - SAME 

VENDORS and VILLAGERS haggle and compete as they sell bread,  
dates, olives, spices, utensils, and all manner of trinkets.  
Daniel makes his way through the busy marketplace self- 
consciously begging for food.   

                         DANIEL 
             Please, do you have any food? 

                         BAKER 
            Move on, boy.  

Daniel weaves through the crowd. 

                         FRUIT VENDOR 
             Get out of here you thief! 

Desperate, Daniel approaches another STREET VENDOR. 

                         DANIEL 
             Please, I’m so hungry. 

The Vendor takes pity on the disheveled Daniel.  

                         STREET VENDOR 
            What happened to you?  

The Street Vendor hands Daniel a piece of flat bread. 

                         DANIEL 
            My mother...they killed her.  

The Vendor reaches for a handful of dates for Daniel.  

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Killed her? 

                         DANIEL 
                  (through mouthfuls) 
            We left from Shechem and she... 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Shechem? You’re from Shechem? 

                         DANIEL 
             Yes, we were going to... 

------------------7---------------

                                                                     66.. 

The Street Vendor grabs the food back from Daniel. 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Samaritan! You’re a Samaritan. Be  
             gone, you son of an apostate! 

                         DANIEL 
            But... 

                         STREET VENDOR 
            Leave before I beat you! 

The Street Vendor lunges at Daniel. Shocked, Daniel retreats.  

                         STREET VENDOR (CONT’D) 
            He’s a Samaritan!  Beware! 

Humiliated, hungry, angry, Daniel stumbles backwards. The  
Street Vendor turns his back to Daniel as he yells...  

                         STREET VENDOR (CONT’D) 
            He’s a filthy Samaritan!! 

In anger and spite, Daniel sneaks a piece of bread and a  
handful of dates from the Street Vendor.   

                         STREET VENDOR (CONT’D) 
            Hey, stop thief!  

Daniel runs. 

                         STREET VENDOR (CONT’D) 
             Just like a thieving Samaritan.  
             Steal our temple! Steal my bread! 

Daniel dodges carts, goats, and people as he runs, Street  
Vendor in pursuit. But, the older man is no match for  
Daniel’s young legs. Daniel escapes. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM ALLEYWAY - LATER 

Daniel turns a corner and ducks into an alleyway. Breathing  
heavily, he slumps down. He greedily eats the stolen food. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - LATER 

Head down and despondent, Daniel wanders aimlessly through  
the Village Square. Ahead, he sees a blind beggar, CALEB,  
late teens, pleading for aid from the passersby.   

                         CALEB 
             Spare a trifle? Anyone? 

------------------8---------------

                                                                     77.. 

Caleb is part huckster, part beggar; lots of different parts. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Come now! I’m here for your  
            benefit! Prove your dedication to  
            the holy scriptures by helping the  
            blind and destitute. 

Daniel wanders closer. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             I’m doing you a favor! Don’t let my  
            misfortune go to waste. 

Daniel watches, noticing that few pay any attention to the  
crippled beggar. With a glance over his shoulder, Daniel  
leaves.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 

Daniel returns to the small alleyway. The streets are quiet  
now. Daniel pulls out his satchel from behind some stones and  
other rubble where it has been hidden. He removes his  
blanket. Pulls it around his shoulders.   

He kneels and begins to recite the Shema. 

                         DANIEL 
            Hear, O Israel,: The Lord, our God,  
             the Lord is one... 

Exhausted, Daniel lays down and pulls the blanket tight  
around himself.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
                  (whispered) 
            Blessed is the name of His glorious  
            kingdom for eternity... 

Daniel sobs. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM, WELL - DAY 

Many VILLAGERS gather around the communal well. They talk and  
laugh about the comings and goings of this little town.   

From a distance, Daniel watches. His hair is longer. His face  
is dirty. His clothes are more worn.   

He watches CHILDREN play and interact with their MOTHERS near  
the well. His face shows his envy and sadness. 

------------------9---------------

                                                                     88.. 

A WOMAN draws a goat skin filled with water from the well.  
Beside her, a basket of bread sits unattended. Daniel waits  
until the Woman is turned. He smoothly walks by pocketing a  
piece of bread without drawing any attention.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - LATER 

Daniel sits in the shade eating his bread and a few raisins.  
He watches Caleb in the Square. He absent-mindedly twirls his  
mother’s ring in his fingers. 

                         CALEB 
             I am here to save you from  
            yourselves!... 

Caleb shakes one small coin from his wooden cup.  

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Hard-hearted, indeed. 

Daniel carefully, quietly sets the last of his bread and some  
raisins on the cloth in front of Caleb. Then, backs away. 

Caleb discovers the food. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Blessed are You, our God, Ruler of  
            the universe, who is good and  
             causes good. 

Daniel melts into the crowd. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - DAY 

Yelling. Shouting. At the center of the disturbance is Caleb.  
Three ruffians have taken his crutch and are taunting him.  
MICAH, 13, black hair, black eyes. SILAS, 12, tall, thin. And  
JAAKOB, the ringleader, 14, strong, intimidating.  

The three circle Caleb poking him with his own crutch,  
tossing it back and forth. 

                         MICAH 
            Lose something? 

Caleb hobbles and lunges towards the voices. 

                         CALEB 
             So, brave picking on the blind  
             cripple.  

------------------10---------------

                                                                     99.. 

                         SILAS 
             I don’t see what the problem is! 

Daniel steps in and rips the crutch from Jaakob. 

                         DANIEL 
             Leave him alone. 

Daniel hands the crutch back to Caleb. Jaakob overcomes his  
shock and steps towards Daniel ready for a fight. Micah and  
Silas step in beside him. 

A young girl, CHAVA, 13, long hair, shows great courage  
standing up to the bullies. 

                         CHAVA 
             Stop it! Micah! Leave him be! 

                         SILAS 
             Oh, Chava cares for the cripple! 

                         CHAVA 
             Silas! You should be ashamed! 

She turns on Jaakob. 

                         CHAVA (CONT’D) 
             Jaakob! Why?! Why do this!!?? 

                         JAAKOB 
            We’re just having a little fun.  
            We’re not hurting... 

                         CHAVA 
             I’ll tell mother. 

Chava’s threat changes the dynamic. Jaakob and the two  
bullies retreat. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Have to have a girl stand up for  
            you? 

                         CHAVA 
             Quiet, Jaakob! 

Chava glances back at Daniel as she follows the others. 

Daniel, holding the crutch, stands in front of Caleb. He  
reaches it out and touches Caleb’s arm with it. Caleb grabs  
it defensively and then realizes it’s his crutch. 

                         CALEB 
             Thank you. 

------------------11---------------

                                                                    1100.. 

Daniel says nothing and walks away. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            You’re the one who brings me food. 

Daniel turns back. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             “Blessed are You, Lord our God,  
            King of the Universe who creates  
            varieties of nourishment.” 

                         DANIEL 
            What is that? 

                         CALEB 
             It’s a berakhah, a blessing. I  
             spend a lot of time in front of the  
             synagogue. Learn a few things. 

                         DANIEL 
            How did you know? 

                         CALEB 
             I can hear your steps, the way you  
            walk.  

Caleb clumsily sits down. Offers his hand. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             I’m Caleb.  

Daniel doesn’t answer or take the offered greeting. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Well, then. I’d offer you something  
            to eat and drink but my servants  
             are busy at the moment. 

                         DANIEL 
            What happened? 

                         CALEB 
            God knew I would be so handsome, no  
             girls would be able to resist me.  
             So, he had me born blind and then  
            ran over me with a cart so that  
            boys like you would one day stand a  
            chance.  

                         DANIEL 
            A chance? 

------------------12---------------

                                                                    1111.. 

                         CALEB 
            At...well...how old are you? 

                         DANIEL 
             Ten, maybe eleven. 

                         CALEB 
            Ah, then...never mind. 

                         DANIEL 
            You really got run over by a cart? 

                         CALEB 
            Yes.  

                         DANIEL 
            Where are your mother and father? 

Caleb grows serious. His carefree facade gone. 

                         CALEB 
             I was the lucky one. 

                         DANIEL 
            Lucky? 

Caleb rapidly changes the painful subject. 

                         CALEB 
            What’s your name? 

                         DANIEL 
            Daniel. 

Caleb extends his hand, again. Tentatively, Daniel shakes it.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - SAME 

From across the Square, Chava has been watching Caleb and  
Daniel. Glancing back, she walks off a side street. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM INN - MORNING 

At a crossroads, NATHAN, jovial innkeeper, a bear of a man,  
shakes out a rug in front of his travelers’ establishment.  
The Inn sits at a point were several roads come together.  

Nathan and his FAMILY, including his wife, RACHEL, scurry  
around making preparations for Passover. The family dog,  
SHIRA, happily runs between guests. TRAVELERS fill the inn.  
Business is good. The harried BAKER hands a basket of  
unleavened bread to Nathan. 

------------------13---------------

                                                                    1122.. 

                         BAKER 
            That’s all until after Shabbat. 

                         NATHAN 
            Fine. We won’t need anything but  
            matzah until after Passover. 

                         BAKER 
            You don’t need a baker for that! 

The Baker rushes out.  

                         NATHAN 
            Mazal tov! 

                         BAKER 
            Ha! God willing! 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - MORNING 

Daniel walks through the morning streets as they come to  
life. SHEPHERDS guide their goats to market. SHOP OWNERS open  
doors. Hebrew STUDENTS follow their RABBI. A young MAN leads  
a teenage GIRL riding a donkey in b.g.  

Daniel’s ring dangles in view outside his tunic. He’s trying  
to get his blanket rolled up and slung across his shoulder.  
Turning a corner, he looks up and stops in his tracks.  
Jaakob, Micha, and Silas have turned onto the same street.  

Daniel turns to run. Jaakob and the others run after him.  
Daniel gets tangled up in his blanket and satchel strap.  
Jaakob, Micha, and Silas catch up and surround him.   

                         JAAKOB 
            The cripple-lover. 

He sees Daniel’s ring and snatches it, breaking the cord.  

                         DANIEL 
            NO!!! 

Jaakob laughs and runs off, taunting Daniel. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Mine now! 

Enraged, Daniel races after Jaakob. Micah and Silas follow. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - SAME 

Jaakob runs thru the streets holding the ring above his head. 

------------------14---------------

                                                                    1133.. 

                         DANIEL 
             Give me my ring! 

Daniel runs hard but is losing ground to the older, stronger  
Jaakob.  Micha and Silas are gaining from behind.  

Daniel glances at his surroundings as he runs. Suddenly, he  
cuts into a narrow passageway and is gone. 

EXT. NARROW PASSAGEWAY - SAME 

Micha and Silas stop and look back behind them through the  
dark passageway. Breathing heavily, they see no sign of  
Daniel. They run after Jaakob. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - SAME 

Jaakob looks back over his shoulder...no Daniel.  

Micah and Silas appear behind him.   

                         JAAKOB 
             Did you see him? Where is he? 

                         SILAS 
             He turned into an alley. 

                         MICAH 
             He’s gone. 

Jaakob twirls the ring around his finger, smugly.  The three  
walk off into the streets of the village.  

But Daniel is watching.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM INN - SAME 

Nathan sets a terracotta water vessel near the door. He calls  
from the doorway. 

                         NATHAN 
             Shira! Shira! 

The dog trots up and runs inside. Nathan follows. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - SAME 

SERIES 

Daniel peeking around a corner.  

------------------15---------------

                                                                    1144.. 

Jaakob, Micha, and Silas running over the stone street. 

Daniel running down an alley. 

The three running up some steps. Unseen, Daniel marks their  
progress. 

Daniel running up another series of steps and making a turn. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM INN - SAME 

Daniel peeks from behind the stone wall of the Inn. Nathan  
sets down a second water vessel and heads around the outside.  

Daniel sees Jaakob, Micah, and Silas coming towards him. He  
pulls back. Daniel removes his satchel from around his neck  
and wraps the shoulder strap tightly around his hand.  

Unsuspecting, Jaakob, Micah, and Silas pass the wall where  
Daniel is hidden. After they pass, Daniel stands up, swings  
the satchel and levels Jaakob with a blow to the back. 

Jaakob tumbles forward right in front of the Inn’s entrance,  
just as Nathan exits the door. Jaakob falls into Nathan  
knocking over one of the large water containers. Daniel  
throws himself into Jaakob. 

                         DANIEL 
            Give me my ring!! 

Shira joins the fray adding to the chaos. 

Surprised, Micah and Silas spin around as Jaakob and Nathan  
sit up in the middle of the remnants of the broken jug.  

                         NATHAN 
            What is this???!!! 

Stunned, Jaakob sits in the mess, holding the now forgotten  
ring. Daniel snatches it from Jaakob. 

Nathan grabs Jaakob and Daniel. Daniel’s attention is fixated  
only on his mother’s ring.   

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
             Shira! Quiet! 

Startled, Silas rushes over next to Micah. They both step  
back, intimidated by the big Innkeeper.  

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
            You’ll be working several days to  
            pay for this!! 

------------------16---------------

                                                                    1155.. 

Daniel regards the ring. His anger calms and he makes a bold  
and risky decision. 

                         DANIEL 
             It’s my fault. 

Jaakob looks wide-eyed at Daniel. Micah and Silas, likewise. 

                         NATHAN 
             Your fault?? 

                         DANIEL 
             I pushed him.  

Suspicious, Nathan reluctantly lets Jaakob go. 

                         NATHAN 
            Well then, start cleaning this up. 

Jaakob pulls himself up. He doesn’t know what to think. 

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
             The rest of you; on your way! 

Micah and Silas run off like they’ve just cheated death.  
Jaakob backs away looking at Daniel.  

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
             Come on, gather up all the broken  
             shards. 

Daniel looks at his ring. The leather cord is broken. He  
glances back at Jaakob. They lock eyes. Jaakob breaks the  
stare and runs off. 

EXT. INN - LATER 

Daniel has the broken shards gathered in a woven basket. The  
mess is now only a damp spot of sand in front of the Inn.  
Shira sits by Daniel. Nathan steps to the door. 

                         NATHAN 
                  (satisfied) 
             Hmmm.  

Nathan has many questions about Daniel.  

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
             ...are you hungry? 

Shira perks up. 

------------------17---------------

                                                                    1166.. 

                         DANIEL 
                  (lying) 
            No. 

Nathan eyes him knowingly. 

                         NATHAN 
            Come on. 

Daniel follows Nathan inside. 

EXT. INN - LATER 

Nathan directs the activity handing Daniel a basket of bread. 

                         NATHAN 
            Daniel! Take these to the pantry.  
            Tell my wife that these will have  
            to be out of the house before  
             sunset.  

Daniel takes the basket and hurries off.  

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
            Then, come right back! I need the  
             stable cleaned before sunset as  
            well! 

INT. INN - DUSK 

Nathan, Rachel and their family prepare for the Seder.   

Daniel enters. 

                         NATHAN 
             So...the setting sun has saved you  
             from more labor.  

Daniel offers a tired sigh. 

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
            You’ve done fine work.  

Nathan drops two small coins in Daniel’s hand. 

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
            Now, you must hurry to make it home  
            before your Passover begins. 

Daniel is pleased but covers his reaction.  

------------------18---------------

                                                                    1177.. 

                         NATHAN (CONT’D) 
             I will see you tomorrow. 

                         DANIEL 
             Tomorrow? 

                         NATHAN 
             You don’t expect me to clean up  
             after all these people on my own??? 

                         RACHEL 
             Goodbye, Daniel. Sweet Pesach to  
             your family. 

                         DANIEL 
             Tomorrow. 

Daniel steps out into the street. Shira follows. Daniel  
scratches her head and sends her back inside. 

EXT. INN - LATER 

Daniel sits in the shadows watching The Inn. One-by-one, the  
last candles are extinguished in the upper rooms. Quiet. 

INT. INN - LATER 

The lower rooms of the inn are dark.  

Daniel quietly sneaks through the rooms. 

Shira intercepts him as if she’d been waiting. Daniel  
scratches her head, happy to see her. 

INT. INN, PANTRY - SAME  

Daniel carefully steals a piece of cheese and some grapes.  

EXT. GROTTO BEHIND THE INN - MOMENTS LATER 

Daniel sneaks into the grotto where the animals are kept.  
Making sure he isn’t seen, he quietly ducks inside. Shira  
follows, tail and head low. 

INT. GROTTO BEHIND THE INN - SAME 

Daniel pushes by an ox patting its back. He whispers to the  
donkey, scratching its ears.  

------------------19---------------

                                                                     1188.. 

He uncovers a hidden loaf of bread he was supposed to get rid  
of. He shoos the chickens away and enjoys his stolen feast  
sharing it with Shira. 

INT. GROTTO BEHIND THE INN - LATER 

Daniel, fast asleep, is awakened by a lamb licking at his  
face. Startled at first, he pushes the lamb away. Groggy, he  
closes his eyes. But...he hears voices. 

Groans and sounds of pain... 

Daniel draws himself deeper into the hay to hide. The moaning  
continues. A scream! Fear courses through Daniel’s face.  

Then...the cry of a newborn baby.  

Daniel’s fear turns to wonder. He carefully crawls from his  
hiding place. Without revealing himself, he peeks between  
woven baskets and farm implements. 

INT. GROTTO BEHIND THE INN, MANGER - SAME 

DANIEL’S POV 

In the warm light of oil lamps and candles, an exhausted  
teenage MARY perspires as she gratefully holds BABY JESUS on  
her chest. Rachel tends to her as JOSEPH holds Mary’s hand  
and marvels at his new son.   

Shira trots to Rachel, revealing Daniel. Rachel beckons to  
him. Apprehensive, Daniel kneels beside Mary. Joseph tenderly  
kisses Mary’s forehead.  

                         JOSEPH 
             You did it.  

Daniel is overwhelmed with the love, warmth, and peace he  
feels as he watches Mary and Joseph care for their baby.  
Longingly, Daniel holds the ring around his neck. A lot of  
conflicting emotions whirl inside Daniel. 

Tentatively, Daniel reaches toward the baby. He strokes it  
softly. Daniel smiles in response to the joy he feels. 

A commotion outside breaks the peaceful scene.  

INT. GROTTO BEHIND THE INN, DOORWAY - SAME 

SHEPHERDS look in with a mix of joy, awe, and reverence.  

------------------20---------------

                                                                    1199.. 

                         SHEPHERD 1 
                  (embarrassed) 
            An angel told us to come... 

Another whispers the words of Isaiah. 

                         SHEPHERD 2 
             “...a virgin shall conceive, and  
             bear a son... 

                         SHEPHERD 3 
             “...the everlasting Father, the  
             Prince of Peace..” 

                         SHEPHERD 1 
             He is the Messiah? 

Mary nods her head, “Yes.” 

The Shepherds carry gifts from their passover feast;  
unleavened bread, dates, and wine are given to Joseph. One  
Shepherd lays a lamb near the manger.   

Daniel absorbs everything, experiencing a warmth he hasn’t  
felt in a long time.  He too is inspired to give a gift.  

Carefully, Daniel removes the braided leather around his  
neck. A makeshift knot repairs the break from earlier in the  
day. He holds it momentarily. Will he really give away this  
treasure? He hands his precious ring to Mary.  

Daniel smiles. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - DAY 

Daniel and Caleb share a bunch of grapes as the crowds  
shuffle around them.  

                         DANIEL 
             ...They called him the Messiah. 

                         CALEB 
            Would the Messiah be born in a cave  
            with cows and donkeys? 

                         DANIEL 
             It didn’t feel like a cave.  

Daniel remembers the feeling of love with the Holy Family. 

------------------21---------------

                                                                    2200.. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             ...I can’t explain it. It felt  
            warm. Like everyone belonged. Even  
            the cows and donkeys... 

                         CALEB 
                  (wistful) 
             I’d like to feel that. 

                         DANIEL 
             I haven’t felt that since... 

Daniel trails off... 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             ...Come on. Time for you to get to  
            work.  

Daniel helps Caleb move to his spot to beg. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - LATER 

The usual gathering of people goes about their daily tasks.  
Daniel and Caleb work the crowd for alms. 

Jaakob, Micah, Silas, and Chava appear.  

Daniel moves closer to Caleb. 

                         DANIEL 
            Give me your crutch. 

                         CALEB 
            Why? 

Daniel takes the crutch and assumes a defensive posture in  
front of Caleb. 

                         DANIEL 
            Get outta here! 

                         CALEB 
                  (false bravado) 
            We’ll show no mercy this time! 

Chava shoves Jaakob from behind.  

                         JAAKOB 
                  (hesitating) 
            Why didn’t you tell the Innkeeper  
            the truth? 

Uncomfortable, Daniel shrugs his shoulders. 

------------------22---------------

                                                                    2211.. 

                         DANIEL 
             I don’t know. 

Chava nudges Jaakob.  

                         CHAVA 
            Do it! I’ll tell mother.  

                         JAAKOB 
                  (reluctant) 
             I’m...sorry. 

                         CALEB 
            You should never start what you  
             can’t finish! 

Caleb is confused.  

                         JAAKOB 
             I’m Jaakob. 

                         DANIEL 
            Daniel. 

                         CALEB 
                  (low) 
            What’s happening? 

Jaakob backs away then, turns with the others. But, Chava  
smiles and waves back at Daniel. Daniel returns the wave. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Daniel??? 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - DAY 

Daniel, hair longer, runs between carts, draft animals and  
people. He sees Chava in front of her home. 

                         DANIEL 
             Chava! Come on let’s go! 

                         CHAVA 
            Where? 

                         DANIEL 
             The Innkeeper needs me to pick up a  
            menorah from the Carpenter. It’s  
            the baby I told you about. Come on! 

                         CHAVA 
             The baby?! 

------------------23---------------

                                                                    2222.. 

She runs off with Daniel. 

EXT. JOSEPH’S HOME - DAY 

Slabs of wood, pieces of stone, saws, chisels, partially  
completed projects fill the small courtyard where Joseph  
works with a plane on a door. Daniel and Chava race to the  
courtyard gate. 

                         DANIEL 
             Good morning! 

                         JOSEPH 
                  (pleased) 
            Well, the lad who watched over our  
             newborn. Who is your lovely friend?  

                         DANIEL 
             Chava. 

                         JOSEPH 
             The pleasure is mine, Chava. What  
             brings you to our home? 

                         DANIEL 
             The Innkeeper, Nathan, asked me to  
             pick up a menorah that you were  
            making. 

                         JOSEPH 
             Yes. It’s inside. Wait a moment.  

Joseph ducks inside while Daniel and Chava explore the many  
tools and well-crafted items. Shira curiously inspects  
everything. 

                         JOSEPH O.C. 
             There’s someone who wants to see  
             you. 

Daniel and Chava turn to see Joseph carrying the young Jesus  
followed by Mary. Chava is entranced.  

                         CHAVA 
             How beautiful! 

                         JOSEPH 
             Mary, this is Chava. 

                         MARY 
             Chava. Hello, Daniel. 

Daniel looks at the growing baby. 

------------------24---------------

                                                                    2233.. 

                         DANIEL 
             He’s getting bigger! 

                         JOSEPH 
             That’s what they do.  

                         DANIEL 
            What did you name him? 

                         MARY 
             Jesus.  

                         CHAVA 
             Jesus... 

                         JOSEPH 
             Here, hold him while I get the  
            menorah for Nathan. 

                         DANIEL 
            No...I...  

                         CHAVA 
             I’ll hold him! 

Mary helps Chava hold the baby as Joseph goes inside again. 

                         MARY 
            Look at you! I’ll bet you are a  
             great help to your Mother. 

Chava smiles bashfully, while enthralled by the baby boy. 

Joseph exits the home carrying a beautifully tooled menorah. 

                         DANIEL 
             That’s...You made that? 

                         JOSEPH 
            Mmhmm.  

Daniel admires the beautifully crafted wood.  

                         JOSEPH (CONT’D) 
             You ever learn how to use tools?  
             Your father ever teach you?  

Daniel lets down his guard.  

                         DANIEL 
             I...I...I never knew my father.  
             Died before I was born.  

------------------25---------------

                                                                    2244.. 

                         MARY 
             I’m sorry. You must be a great  
             comfort to your mother.  

Daniel reveals his secret. 

                         DANIEL 
             She’s dead, too.  

A solemn silence falls over them. Chava is surprised at  
Daniel’s revelation. Shame creeps up on him. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I better go.  

He takes the Menorah. Quietly leaves. Chava watches. 

                         JOSEPH 
            Daniel! I need some help on a  
            project for the baker’s shop. He  
             needs another table. I could use  
             another hand.  

Daniel turns. Nods.  

                         JOSEPH (CONT’D) 
             Tomorrow? 

Daniel nods again.  

Chava kisses the baby on the head and hands him back to Mary.   
She runs after Daniel. 

                         MARY 
            Bye, Chava. Goodbye, Daniel! 

Daniel doesn’t look back. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - DAY 

Daniel, eyes front, walks with the menorah. Chava catches up  
to him. They walk in silence for a few moments.  

                         CHAVA 
             I’m sorry.  

Daniel walks with his head down.  

                         DANIEL 
            We were leaving our home...in  
             Samaria.  

------------------26---------------

                                                                    2255.. 

Daniel keeps walking. Chava is stopped in her tracks by the  
word, “Samaria.” Eyes wide, her gaze follows Daniel.  

Daniel stops. Faces her. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Yes. Samaria.  

Taking a step back, Chava struggles for something to say.  
Believing she’s rejecting him, Daniel sighs and walks away. 

Chava fights to overcome the fear and prejudice of the  
culture. Finally, she catches up to Daniel.   

They walk in silence. After a long moment, Chava takes  
Daniel’s hand. 

Daniel continues walking and hazards a glance at Chava.  

                                                       DISSOLVE TO: 

EXT. BETHLEHEM MARKET - EVENING 

Amidst the noise and motion of the end of the market day, the  
Street Vendor who threatened Daniel when he first arrived  
talks quietly with two CUSTOMERS. 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             ...Herod himself! 

                         CUSTOMER #1 
             ...lecherous old... 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Shhhh! Quiet! His spies are  
             everywhere. 

                         CUSTOMER #2 
             But, a child? Why would he want to  
             know about a child? 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Herod fears everything and  
             everyone.  

                         CUSTOMER #1 
             Heaven be praised, my children are  
             grown. 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Hmm. I wouldn’t let my children out  
             of my sight... 

------------------27---------------

                                                                    2266.. 

Behind the conversation, where he is not seen, Daniel listens  
with concern. He carefully sneaks away. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - LATER 

Daniel walks quickly and then, runs. 

INT. JOSEPH’S HOME - EVENING  

                         JOSEPH O.C. 
             He’s fine. We’re fine... 

Candles glow in the fading light. A fire burns in the hearth.  
Joseph and Mary, holding Jesus, try to ease Daniel’s concern.  

                         DANIEL 
             But, they said Herod is looking for  
             a child. What if he’s looking for  
             Jesus? 

                         MARY 
            Why would the king have anything to  
             do with a poor babe like ours? 

Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. 

Joseph, Mary, and Daniel all exchange glances.  

                         DANIEL 
             Spies! 

Cautiously, Mary shields baby Jesus.  

Another knock. 

DOOR 

Warily, Joseph answers the door.  

The opening door reveals three mysterious men in hooded  
robes, holding the reins of their Arabian mounts. They remove  
their hoods. In a strange accent, the first steps forward. 

                         WISE MAN #1 
            We have come to worship the King.  

INT. JOSEPH'S HOME - LATER 

The WISE MEN kneel before an embarrassed Mary and a confused  
Joseph.  

------------------28---------------

                                                                    2277.. 

Underneath their plain cloaks are the robes and vestments of  
royalty. Gold, frankincense, and myrrh cover the floor.  

The young Jesus crawls around and grabs a handful of myrrh.  
Mary catches him before he can put it in his mouth.   

                         WISE MAN #3 
            Again, forgive our unannounced  
             arrival.  

                         WISE MAN #2 
             Discretion seemed the best course  
             of action. 

                         MARY 
             No, we thank you.  

                         JOSEPH 
            We don’t know what to say.  

                         WISE MAN #2 
             Come, we must make haste while  
             darkness covers our departure.  

                         JOSEPH 
             No, please, wait until morning.  

                         WISE MAN #2 
            We do not wish to draw Herod’s  
             attention. We must return to our  
             attendants and animals who await us  
             beyond the city. 

                         WISE MAN #1 
             It has been revealed to us to avoid  
             Jerusalem.  

Daniel has overheard.  

                         DANIEL 
             I can show you another way. 

All eyes turn towards Daniel. 

                         JOSEPH 
             Daniel knows these streets as well  
             as anyone.  

                         DANIEL 
             I’ll take them to the East gate.  
             Point them towards Beit Sahur.  

------------------29---------------

                                                                    2288.. 

                         JOSEPH 
            Yes. If you have doubts, head east  
             or south. You will be beyond  
             Jerusalem in a few hours. 

                         WISE MAN #3 
             Thank you, Joseph. God’s blessings  
            upon you.  

                         WISE MAN #2 
            We are grateful to have seen the  
            prophecy fulfilled. 

                         WISE MAN #1 
             I can die in peace. I have seen the  
            King of Kings. 

                         DANIEL 
            Ready?  

The Wise Men nod. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREET - NIGHT 

Daniel and the three hooded riders carefully make their way,  
hooves echoing in the deserted streets. Daniel rides with the  
leading Wise Man. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM GATE - NIGHT 

The Wise Men stop after they pass through the town gate. 

                         DANIEL 
            Follow the road that way and you’ll  
             stay far from Jerusalem. 

                         WISE MAN #1 
             Thank you, Daniel.  

The Wise Man helps Daniel down. 

                         WISE MAN #1  (CONT’D) 
            Your help is greatly appreciated. 

The Wise Man’s mount nibbles at Daniel.  

                         WISE MAN #1 (CONT’D) 
            He has taken to you.  

                         DANIEL 
            Animals seem to like me. 

------------------30---------------

                                                                   2299.. 

                         WISE MAN #1 
            He is a good judge of character. 

The Wise Man tosses Daniel a coin. He catches it.  

                         WISE MAN #1 (CONT’D) 
            For your family. 

Daniel looks at the coin.  

                         WISE MAN #1 (CONT’D) 
            Farewell, Daniel. 

They disappear into the night. Daniel watches them go.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM SQUARE - DAY 

While the crowds make their way back and forth through the  
busy Square, Daniel shows his friends the beautiful gold coin  
from the night before. 

                         MICAH 
            You should buy a herd of goats. 

                         ALL 
                  (laughing, teasing) 
            What? Goats?! 

                         MICAH 
            Goats! You can sell their milk. Eat  
            them if you’re hungry. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Where would he keep them? 

                         MICAH 
            Oh... 

                         CHAVA 
            I would buy a beautiful gown with a  
            golden necklace and pearl ear  
            rings. 

                         DANIEL 
            Pearl ear rings? 

                         SILAS 
            When would you ever wear them? 

                         CHAVA 
            When I get married! 

All the boys sneer and jeer good-naturedly.  

------------------31---------------

                                                                    3300.. 

                         JAAKOB 
            A horse. You should buy a horse. 

                         CALEB 
             Do you have enough to feed it? 

                         DANIEL 
             I don’t know how much it’s worth. 

                         CALEB 
            What does it look like? How big?  

Daniel puts the coin in Caleb’s hand.  

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             Oh. It’s heavy.  

Caleb tosses it back and forth in his hands.  

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             You should keep it. Someday, you  
             can do something good with it...  

He reaches to give it back to Daniel. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             Goodness is always returned. 

Daniel pockets his coin, thinking of Caleb’s words. 

EXT. JOSEPH'S HOME - DAY 

Daniel puts the finishing touches on a new crutch. Joseph  
checks his work.  

                         JOSEPH 
            Well done. Good work. 

                         DANIEL 
             Caleb has needed it for a long  
             time.  

With a grin, Daniel runs off with the crutch. He turns back  
and waves. Joseph waves back and, smiling, shakes his head. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM MARKET - LATER 

The crowd mixes and moves with the energy of midday. The same  
Street Vendor hawks his wares. Caleb is working the crowd.    

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Come and buy! Come and buy! 

------------------32---------------

                                                                    3311.. 

                         CALEB 
            Alms! Alms! I’m here for your  
             salvation! 

Daniel, Chava, Jaakob, Micah, and Silas approach cautiously.  
Daniel pokes at Caleb with the new crutch. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Whoever you are, you’re not helping  
            your case for salvation.   

Daniel prods him again. The others stifle laughs. Caleb grabs  
the crutch and pulls it from his tormentor’s hands. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             Ha! Now, let’s see how clever you  
             are. Enjoy your time in Sheol. 

Caleb spins the “stick” around in his hands. Daniel is silent  
as Caleb discovers with his hands that the “stick” is a  
finely crafted crutch. He looks around with a grin. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             Daniel? Daniel! 

Daniel steps closer. 

                         DANIEL 
            What do you think? A respectable   
             beggar should have a better crutch. 

                         CALEB 
             This is a fine crutch! Daniel!  
             Thank you! 

Caleb tries it out. He’s very pleased. Chava and the others  
gather around, slapping Caleb’s back. 

Daniel hears horses.  

Across the Market, the CAPTAIN of Herod’s Mercenaries rides  
in followed by 20 ARMED MERCENARIES who push into the crowd.  
One Mercenary unrolls a scroll and begins reading... 

                         READER 
             By order of Herod, King of Judea,  
             all male children under two years  
             of age from the town of Bethlehem,  
             are to be brought to the town  
             square... 

Other Mercenaries dismount and draw swords. They move into  
the town. The Mercenary Captain rides his nervous mount.  

------------------33---------------

                                                                     3322.. 

                         CALEB 
             What’s happening? 

                         DANIEL 
             Soldiers. Stay here.  

Daniel climbs to where he can see better. In the distance,  
wailing screams pierce the air. 

                         CHAVA 
             What are they doing? 

A Mercenary chases a woman carrying a child, shoves her to  
the ground and raises his sword. Daniel’s face reflects the  
horror unfolding. 

                         DANIEL 
             They’re killing the children!! 

Daniel looks back at Chava’s shocked face as he runs off. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREETS, CONTINUOUS - DAY 

Daniel runs through the streets towards Mary and Joseph’s. He  
passes a YOUNG WOMAN, hands on her face, wailing.  

He turns a corner. Mercenaries rush ahead of him. They leave  
a stunned woman laying on the ground with blood on her hands.  

Daniel’s face is shocked. Eyes wide. More screams and groans. 

Daniel reaches the Carpenter’s home. 

EXT. JOSEPH'S HOME - DAY 

Daniel sprints up to the gate.  

                         DANIEL 
             Joseph! Joseph? 

No answer. The tools are abandoned. Daniel opens the door. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Mary?? Mary!!...Jesus? 

Daniel is confused. They are gone. The distant screams mount.  
He runs back to the Market. 

------------------34---------------

                                                                    3333.. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM MARKET - SAME 

Daniel enters to pandemonium. People run. Women scream and  
run with their babies. Mercenaries follow with drawn swords.  
Caleb is jostled and knocked around. The Street Vendor sits  
in the ruins of his cart and wares. 

Chava cries. Micah and Silas run from the Market and escape. 

                         CALEB 
             Daniel!!! 

Daniel makes his way to Caleb. He collapses to his knees.  
Chava rushes over. Jaakob stands, stunned.  

Amidst the dust and screams, the Captain of the Mercenaries  
rides towards Daniel and his friends, sword drawn. Fearing  
they will be killed as well, they cower.  But, Daniel  
resolutely steps between the Captain and his friends.  

The Street Vendor, eyes blazing, follows the Captain.  

The Captain pulls his horse up; lowers his sword. 

                         DANIEL 
            Why?!! 

                         MERCENARY CAPTAIN 
             There cannot be two Kings in Judea. 

Seeing the exchange between Daniel and the Captain, the  
enraged Street Vendor rushes towards Daniel. Chava and Jaakob  
reach Daniel.  

The Captain rides to his troops. 

                         STREET VENDOR 
             You. You. You brought this evil! 

                         DANIEL 
            What? No! 

                         CHAVA 
             He didn’t do anything! 

The Street Vendor turns to the stunned, grieving and shocked  
crowd. The fuse is lit.  

                         STREET VENDOR 
             Samaritan! The Samaritan did this!! 

And the crowd explodes.  

------------------35---------------

                                                                    3344.. 

                         CROWD #1 
             Samaritan! 

                         CROWD #2 
            Kill him! 

Terrified, Daniel scrambles away from the approaching mob. 

                         DANIEL 
             I didn’t do anything! I didn’t do  
             anything!!! 

                         STREET VENDOR 
            God brought this upon us because we  
             let a Samaritan in our town!! 

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel! 

Jaakob rushes towards Chava. Daniel runs for his life. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Samaritan?! Did you know?!! 

                         CHAVA 
             It’s not his fault! 

                         JAAKOB 
            He’s a Samaritan! 

                         CHAVA 
            You know him. You know this isn’t  
            his fault.  

                         JAAKOB 
            Now everyone thinks we’re his  
             friends! 

                         CHAVA 
            We are his friends. 

Tears in her eyes, Chava runs after Daniel and the crowd. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM STREETS - DAY 

Daniel runs frantically through the streets. Knocking over  
baskets, scattering chickens; he scrambles through a back  
alley and hides. The crowd rushes past.  

Terrified, Daniel breathes heavily in his hiding place. 

------------------36---------------

                                                                    3355.. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM OUTSKIRTS - DUSK 

Creeping from behind a cart, Daniel sneaks through the  
Jerusalem Gate. Head down, he carries a tattered satchel and  
worn blanket. He’s leaving Bethlehem as he arrived. 

Just as he’s in the clear, he hears a familiar voice. 

                         CHAVA O.C. 
             Daniel. 

Daniel turns. She reaches the dejected Daniel. Shira  
cautiously approaches. 

                         DANIEL 
             It wasn’t my fault.  

                         CHAVA 
             I know.  

                         DANIEL 
            Why did they leave me? 

                         CHAVA 
            Who? 

                         DANIEL 
             Joseph. Mary. Just when I  
            thought...  

Daniel trails off. 

                         CHAVA 
            What are you going to do? 

                         DANIEL 
            Now that everyone knows I’m a  
             Samaritan... 

Daniel continues. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Leave. Go to Jerusalem. Nobody  
             knows me there.  

Daniel reaches into his robe. He pulls out the coin given to  
him by the Wise Man.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Caleb was wrong.  

Daniel takes Chava’s hand, opens it, and puts the coin in it.  
Chava wipes her eyes. 

------------------37---------------

                                                                    3366.. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Give this to Caleb.  

                         CHAVA 
             Daniel? 

                         DANIEL 
             Promise to take care of him.  

Chava nods her head. Long pause. Daniel must go.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Goodbye, Chava. 

Daniel walks into the darkness. Shira takes a tentative step  
towards Daniel then stops with a sad whine. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, ROMAN JAIL - DAY 

10 YEARS LATER 

The door to the Roman Jail opens. A disheveled 20-something  
yr-old Daniel is pushed unceremoniously outside. 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #1 
             Be gone, swine. 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #2 
             Useless filth. 

Daniel takes offense. 

                         DANIEL 
             Useless?!! 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #2 
             ...filth. 

                         DANIEL 
            Without us Jews you Romans would be  
             stuck. Finished.  

The Soldiers laugh and mock Daniel.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Who would do all the work you lazy  
             invaders refuse to do? 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #1 
            Watch your tongue, scum. 

------------------38---------------

                                                                    3377.. 

                         DANIEL 
            Go ahead. Kill me. Kill all of us.  
             Then you’d have to clean your own  
             latrines; live in your own filth. 

The Soldier menacingly steps towards Daniel. 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #2 
            You dirty... 

                         LONGINUS O.C. 
            Legionnaire...  

The Soldiers snap to attention. The Centurion, LONGINUS, 30’s  
rough, career soldier, on his fearsome war horse, interrupts  
the Soldier.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Your name, Jew. 

                         DANIEL 
            Daniel. 

                         LONGINUS           
            Daniel...hmm... 
                  (to Soldier) 
             Take him back to his cell.   

                         DANIEL 
            What??!! I just got out... 

                         LONGINUS 
            And you’ll go back until you show  
            respect for the Empire, thief. 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #2 
            Yes, Centurion. 

The Legionnaires, carefully avoiding Longinus’s horse, drag  
Daniel away as Longinus dismounts. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Wait. Leave him to me. 

The Legionnaires release Daniel. Daniel looks for escape.  
Longinus draws his sword. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            You run, I’ll kill you.  

Leading his horse, Longinus uses his sword to herd Daniel  
toward the fortress. 

------------------39---------------

                                                                    3388.. 

INT. ROMAN STABLES - DAY 

Sunlight filters through the dust in the stables of the  
Centuria. Longinus leads Daniel inside. 

Daniel hesitantly looks at the surroundings as Longinus leads  
his horse to a stable. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Clean it up. 

                         DANIEL 
             I’m not your slave. 

                         LONGINUS 
            You’re all our slaves. 

                         DANIEL 
            What are my wages? 

Longinus bursts out laughing. 

                         LONGINUS 
            You’re either brave or stupid.  
            Which is it, Hebrew? 

                         DANIEL 
            Depends on who you ask.  

Longinus regards him. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Well, you’re honest. 

Longinus opens a gate to put his horse into a stall. The  
horse resists. Longinus is finally able to get it in and  
close the gate.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             I’ll be back at mid-day. Have it  
             finished. 

Longinus walks out. 

Daniel pauses, then, resigned, sets to work. 

INT. ROMAN STABLES - MIDDAY 

Daniel is covered in dirt and dung. Barrels are loaded with  
horse manure. He’s just filling the last when the Roman  
Soldiers who harassed him earlier enter the stables. 

------------------40---------------

                                                                    3399.. 

Daniel backs away cautiously. Laughing, the Soldiers grab  
Daniel, hold him down, and dump a barrel of manure over him. 

                         ROMAN SOLDIER #1 
            Never forget where you belong. 

They let Daniel up and kick over the other barrels leaving  
the stables in disarray. Hidden by the rush of activity, one  
of the Soldiers unlatches the gate to Longinus’s horse’s  
stall.  

Daniel looks at the mess. He considers running. Then, grabs a  
broken wooden shovel and begins cleaning...again.  

Behind Daniel, the big war horse bolts out of the stall. It  
charges at the surprised Daniel. Daniel rushes to get out of  
the way. The horse bucks and kicks. Daniel dives to avoid the  
snorting beast.   

Daniel tries to escape, but the horse anticipates each move  
and cuts him off. Ears back and teeth bared the horse lunges  
at Daniel. Out of options and with nowhere to run, Daniel  
must stand his ground.  

The horse rears up on its hind legs. In desperation, Daniel  
holds up his hands and calls to the horse. 

                         DANIEL 
             STOP!!! WHOA!!! 

The angry horse drops to all fours.   

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Whoa! Whoa. Easy...easy. 

The horse calms. Tentatively, Daniel approaches. Carefully,  
he reaches out and strokes the horse’s nose.   

                         LONGINUS O.C. 
             Ferox killed the last slave. 

ON LONGINUS who has been watching from the entrance, eating  
an apple. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Brave...stupid...lucky? 

He tosses the apple core to the ground. 

                         DANIEL 
             I’ll chose any of those three over  
             “dead.” 

------------------41---------------

                                                                    4400.. 

                         LONGINUS 
            You’re not finished. 

                         DANIEL 
            No, Centurion. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Finish here and find your way to  
            the armory. 

Daniel’s shoulders sag as Longinus leaves. 

Frustrated, Daniel finds the apple core on the ground. He  
picks it up and walks to the horse’s stall, offering it to  
the now docile animal. The horse chomps on it as Daniel  
scratches his forelock. 

                         DANIEL 
            Ferox.  

INT. ROMAN ARMORY - NIGHT 

Daniel sits amidst rags, buckets, an earthen jar with oil,  
and rows of shields, helmets, and plate armor. He finishes  
polishing the bronze chest piece of an officer as Longinus  
appears with his OPTIO, late 20’s, second in command.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Show me your work. 

Daniel hands Longinus his chest piece. He examines it. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Where are you from? 

Daniel thinks for a moment and then gives a vague answer. 

                         DANIEL 
            Northern Judea. I lived in  
            Bethlehem for a while and then came  
            here to Jerusalem. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Wife? Children? 

                         DANIEL 
            No, Centurion. God has seen fit to  
            bless me with no attachments.  

Longinus considers Daniel for a few moments. 

------------------42---------------

                                                                    4411.. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Put everything in it’s place and  
            you may go.  

Daniel nods and turns back to his work. As Longinus leaves,  
he turns back to Daniel. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            The horses and the men will manage  
            to undo all of your work in a few  
            days. It will need to be re-done.  

Longinus turns to his Optio.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Find him some bread and something  
            remaining from the evening ration.  

                         DANIEL 
                  (surprised) 
            Thank you, Centurion. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Stay out of my jail, thief.  

Longinus and the Optio leave. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE STEPS - NIGHT 

Near the Valley Gate, a beggar sits as the square empties. He  
is blind and holds a familiar crutch--Caleb, now in his 30’s.  

Daniel reaches toward Caleb holding out a bunch of dates.  

                         CALEB 
            Don’t taunt me. 

                         DANIEL 
             It’s not taunting. It’s preparing  
            you for a feast. 

                         CALEB 
            A feast?...Wait...what did you  
             steal this time? 

                         DANIEL 
            Caleb, I didn’t steal anything  
             ...this time. 

Daniel sits alongside Caleb.  

------------------43---------------

                                                                    4422.. 

                         CALEB 
            Uh, who are you and what have you  
             done with my friend, Daniel? 

                         DANIEL 
             Funny. I got a job, sort of. 

                         CALEB 
            Now I know you are NOT Daniel. 

Daniel gathers the food. 

                         DANIEL 
             I can go eat all this by myself... 

                         CALEB 
            Who did you rob this time?  

                         DANIEL 
                  (should he tell him?) 
             The Romans. 

                         CALEB 
             The Roma...well, that makes sense.  
             That’s exactly the kind of thing  
            you’d go and do. You’ll be a  
             pariah.  

                         DANIEL 
             I’m already a pariah. Come on,  
             let’s eat. 

They dig into the humble feast. Caleb shakes his head. 

                         CALEB 
             Following you to Jerusalem was a  
             huge mistake. 

They laugh. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, ALLEY - NIGHT 

Dark, dangerous part of the city. VAGRANTS and HOODLUMS  
gamble on games of chance. In the thick of it is an  
inebriated Daniel. 

A roll of the dice and...Daniel grimaces. He’s lost again. 

                         HOODLUM #1 
             Ha! You must be unclean! Not even  
            your money wants to be near you. 

Laughing, the group of Gamblers mock Daniel’s misfortune. 

------------------44---------------

                                                                    4433.. 

                         DANIEL 
             I’ll be back and take all my money  
             home with me. 

                         HOODLUM #1 
             Of course, you will. You always  
             come back. 

                         HOODLUM #2 
            And, you always lose! 

Daniel hides his bitterness. He stumbles into the night.  He  
is watched by a SHROUDED MAN. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, STREETS - NIGHT 

Daniel walks the darkened streets. His pace slows as he  
approaches a square.   

Two MEN hang from crosses.  

Daniel stares at them grimly as he passes by.  

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE STEPS - DAY 

The CROWDS have returned to the square in front of the steps  
of the temple. VENDORS sell food, animals for offerings;  
MONEY CHANGERS exchange foreign currency for temple coinage.  
Daniel helps Caleb to his place nearby to beg. 

Daniel moves slowly, recovering from a hangover. Caleb is  
quiet. He refuses Daniel’s help. Daniel bows his head  
shamefully. After a long pause... 

                         DANIEL 
             I’m sorry.  

                         CALEB 
                  (laughing) 
            No, you’re not. 

Daniel is silent. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             If you were sorry, you wouldn’t do  
             it again. But you will. 

                         DANIEL 
             It’s just some bad luck. 

------------------45---------------

                                                                     4444.. 

                         CALEB 
             It is not bad luck. It’s bad  
             judgement.   

Daniel ignores Caleb’s protestations.  

                         DANIEL 
             Be quiet. Besides...it’s Passover.  
             Lot of fruit ripe for the picking.  

Daniel rubs his hands together in anticipation as he looks  
around at the crowd of Travelers and Worshippers. 

From the far side, the Shrouded Man eyes Daniel and Caleb. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE MOUNT - DAY 

Daniel works through the crowd. Intent on the tables of the  
Money Changers, Daniel is unaware of a small crowd of RABBIS.  

As Daniel passes, he doesn’t see the 12 yr-old BOY in the  
middle of these learned men.  

Reaching the Money Changers, Daniel speaks up.  

                         DANIEL 
             How ’s business? 

                         MONEY CHANGER 
                  (wary) 
             Good. Passover is always  
             profitable. Do you wish to trade  
             for temple coin? 

                         DANIEL 
             No, no.  

As Daniel speaks, he moves closer to the coins on the table.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Look. Over there. Those men. 

ON a GROUP OF MEN by the temple stairs. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Have you seen them here before? 

The Money Changer shakes is head, “no” as he watches the men.  

Daniel slyly slips several coins from the table to his hand. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Samaritans. 

------------------46---------------

                                                                    4455.. 

                         MONEY CHANGER 
             Samaritans... 

                         DANIEL 
             Yes.  Just a warning. 

Daniel slyly moves the coins towards his sash. Before he can  
hide them, he is suddenly bumped into by a rushing Man and  
Woman. The momentum spins him away from them. 

                         MAN 
                  (without looking) 
             Forgive us! 

Daniel is intent on keeping the stolen coins from being seen  
by the Money Changer and on keeping his balance as the couple  
moves on. He doesn’t see them. 

The Man and Woman are MARY and JOSEPH, now ten years older.  
Life has made it’s changes on everyone and because of their  
rush and Daniel’s position, they don’t see each other.  

Mary and Joseph rush to the gathered group of Rabbis.  

Daniel manages to get the stolen coins hidden. 

Mary rushes into the group where the now 12-yr old JESUS  
answers questions of the learned men. The ring hangs on a  
cord around Jesus’s neck. 

                         MARY 
                  (agitated and relieved) 
             Son! Where have you been? Three  
             days we’ve been searching! 

                         JOSEPH 
            Are you alright? 

                         MARY 
            Why have you treated us this way?  
            We have been worried sick. 

                         JESUS 
            Why? I was about my Father’s  
             business. 

Confused by the words, finally, Mary wraps her arms around  
her lost child, now found.  

Daniel quickly makes his way from the crowd surrounding the  
boy and his parents swiping two more coins from the  
distracted merchant. 

------------------47---------------

                                                                    4466.. 

Pleased with himself, Daniel notices a commotion ahead of  
him. 

Caleb is being heckled by three men about the same age as  
Daniel. Daniel charges straight in. 

                         DANIEL 
             Leave him alone! 

                         JAAKOB 
             You’re not happy to see me, old  
             friend? 

Daniel glares at the three persecutors, recognition dawns. 

                         DANIEL 
             Jaakob. 

                         CALEB 
             Jaakob? 

                         JAAKOB 
             Daniel.  

Ten years older, Jaakob, Micah, and Silas are not ten years  
wiser. Jaakob is the Shrouded Man watching Daniel. 

                         DANIEL 
                  (wary) 
            What are you doing here? 

                         JAAKOB 
            What are you doing here? 

                         DANIEL 
             Living the life of a wealthy  
             trader. Food, wine, women... 

                         JAAKOB 
             You enjoy games of chance.  

Caleb reaches out. 

                         CALEB 
             Daniel, no. 

                         DANIEL 
             Perhaps. 

                         JAAKOB 
             It was not a question. I’ve watched  
             you.  

------------------48---------------

                                                                   4477.. 

                         DANIEL 
            You’ve watched me? 

Jaakob shrugs. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Join us tonight. 

                         DANIEL 
            Maybe. 

Caleb shakes his head. 

                         CALEB 
            Unbelievable.  I can always eat my  
            crutch. 

Jaakob makes to leave.  

                         DANIEL 
            Where? 

                         JAAKOB 
            Through the Fish Gate.  

Caleb jumps in and asks the question Daniel wants to ask but  
is afraid to.  

                         CALEB 
            What of Chava? Is she well? 

Jaakob turns back. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Oh, she’s doing very well. So well  
            in fact, she’s betrothed. 

Silas Steps forward. 

                         SILAS 
            To me. 

Daniel shows no reaction. 

                         CALEB 
            Oh...well. Mazel tov.  

                         DANIEL 
            Yes. A long and happy life.   

                         JAAKOB 
            Tonight. Beyond the Fish Gate.   
            You’ll find us. It will be like old  
            days. 

------------------49---------------

                                                                    4488.. 

As Daniel watches them go... 

                         CALEB 
             Don’t even think about it.  

EXT. WALLS OF JERUSALEM - LATER 

Jaakob, Micah, and Silas make their way along the busy  
streets. Well behind them, Daniel follows unobserved. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM, CHAVA’S HOME - LATER 

Daniel watches from behind a corner.  

Micah bids farewell and walks deeper into the town.  

Jaakob and Silas sit outside with other SIBLINGS and two  
older people, Jaakob’s MOTHER and FATHER. Daniel is too far  
away to hear their conversation. The Mother goes inside  
returning shortly with a tray of bread and meat.  

Following her is a dark-haired woman also carrying a tray.  
Chava. 10 years older. Daniel ducks back.  But, then, watches  
once again.   

Silas tries to greet Chava with a kiss. She turns only her  
cheek to him. They laugh and talk with the family. Daniel’s  
forlorn face sags with the inevitable disappointment.  

EXT. BETHLEHEM, CHAVA 'S HOME - EVENING 

Later, Chava gathers plates and cups alone.  

                         DANIEL O.C. 
             Chava. 

Startled, Chava spins around. She steps back cautiously.  
Daniel steps from the shadows, hands raised to reassure her.  

                         CHAVA 
             Daniel? Daniel. 

Tentatively, she steps to the wall. Cautiously, Daniel meets  
her there. Uncomfortably long silence. 

                         DANIEL 
             Hello. 

                         CHAVA 
            What are you doing here?  

------------------50---------------

                                                                    4499.. 

                         DANIEL 
             I followed Jaakob. He found me and  
             Caleb near the temple. 

                         CHAVA 
             Caleb? How is Caleb?  

                         DANIEL 
             Good. Fine. The same. 

Another long silence. 

                         CHAVA 
             You never came back.  

                         DANIEL 
             There was nothing for me here. 

Though it’s been 10 years, even she is surprised how much  
that comment hurt.   

                         CHAVA 
                  (getting even?) 
             Did Jaakob tell you I am betrothed?  

                         DANIEL 
             Yes. Mazel tov.  

                         CHAVA 
             Silas.  

                         DANIEL 
             Yes. Silas. Good. Did you get your  
             ear rings? 

Chava doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. 

                         CHAVA 
            What? Oh...no. 

They both know they’ve missed an opportunity and neither  
knows how to make it right. The silence speaks volumes.  

                         CHAVA (CONT’D) 
            Are you married? 

                         DANIEL 
            No. No.  

Does Chava’s expression reflect a glimmer of hope, or  
desperate resignation? More silence. 

                         CHAVA 
            What work do you do? 

------------------51---------------

                                                                    5500.. 

                         DANIEL 
             The same. I live as I can. Work for  
             the Romans once in a while.  

                         CHAVA 
             The Romans? 

                         DANIEL 
                  (indignant) 
            At least they are willing to let me  
            work for them. And they pay. Not  
             like “God’s chosen.” 

                         CHAVA 
             You should be wary of Jaakob. 

                         DANIEL 
            Why? 

                         CHAVA 
             He’s mixed up with the rebels. I  
            worry he’ll do something rash. 

                         DANIEL 
            What about your betrothed? Silas.  
             Is he “mixed up” as well? 

                         CHAVA 
             He says, “no.”  

More silence.  

                         CHAVA (CONT’D) 
                  (softening) 
            Life’s been hard? 

Daniel lets down his guard a bit. 

                         DANIEL 
            No harder than for all of us under  
            my employers.    

                         CHAVA 
             Once the Messiah comes, that will  
             all change.  

                         DANIEL 
             You believe that, don’t you. 

                         CHAVA 
             Yes. The prophets say so. 

------------------52---------------

                                                                    5511.. 

                         DANIEL 
             I have no need for a phantom  
            Messiah and dead prophets who  
            preach joy and peace but only ever  
             deliver suffering and pain.  

Chava steps closer to the wall, resting her hands on top.  

                         CHAVA 
            No. Daniel. The struggle is what  
             refines and prepares us for His  
            Kingdom.  

Daniel smiles, wistfully. 

                         DANIEL 
            You sound like my mother. You  
             remember that baby? They said he  
            was the Messiah. Did you ever see  
            them again? 

                         CHAVA 
            No. They never returned, either. 

                         DANIEL 
            No. No, they didn’t. 

Daniel places one hand on Chava’s hand on the wall. Something  
familiar and comfortable still exists between them, but the  
circumstances are hopeless.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Good-bye, Chava.  Be happy.  

Daniel turns and fades into Bethlehem’s darkening streets. 

A tear betrays Chava’s feelings. She quickly wipes it away. 

EXT. BETHLEHEM INN - NIGHT 

Daniel sits in the shadows, arms wrapped around his knees. He  
stares at the stables behind Nathan’s Inn.  

Daniel softly hums a song he hasn’t thought of for many years- 
-the song he sang with this Mother that fateful day.  

As he finishes the song, he sees a grizzled old dog. 

                         DANIEL 
             Shira! 

Shira slowly makes her way to Daniel. They are both happy to  
see each other.  

------------------53---------------

                                                                    5522.. 

After a while, Daniel slowly stands. Sadly, he strokes Shira  
and then sends her back to the Inn. With one longing glance  
over his shoulder at what might have been, Daniel makes his  
way back to Jerusalem. Longingly, Shira watches him go. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, ALLEY - NIGHT 

20 YEARS LATER 

In a dingy alley off of the main marketplace, games of chance  
are underway among the RIFF-RAFF of Jerusalem. An older  
Daniel, now in his 40’s rattles the dice in a wooden cup. 

                         RIFF-RAFF #1 
            Enough! Throw the dice, Daniel! 

                         DANIEL 
            Wait, wait... 

He swigs from a wine skin. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            NOW! Now, I am ready! 

He throws the dice against a wall. Made of bone, the ivory  
dice ricochet and spin. The numbers come up. Daniel grimaces.  
The rest of the Riff-Raff laugh and taunt his misfortune.  

                         RIFF-RAFF #2 
            Again! You are making me rich! 

                         DANIEL 
             I’m finished. But, I’ll be back. 

Unsteady, Daniel hauls himself up and works his way through  
the drunken crowd. 

INT. DINGY BACK ROOM - NIGHT 

Inside a dimly lit room, a group of ROUGH MEN pursue a hushed  
discussion around a greasy table. In charge is Jaakob, now  
twenty years older as well, next to him is Silas. With them  
is an innocent teenager, ZACHARY--Silas and Chava’s son.  

Equally ROUGH WOMEN bring food and wine as other Riff-Raff  
come and go. Daniel enters. He looks around. 

                         DANIEL 
             Jaakob. Jaakob! 

Jaakob looks up from the table. Silas rolls his eyes. Daniel  
waits.  

------------------54---------------

                                                                    5533.. 

                         SILAS 
            Not again. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Wait, Silas. He’s useful. 

Jaakob waves Daniel over.  

                         DANIEL 
             Silas. Hello, Zachary! 

Zachary and Daniel share a mutual affection. 

                         ZACHARY 
            Daniel! 

                         DANIEL 
            What are you doing here? Does your  
            mother know you’re here? 

                         SILAS 
            Why do I need Chava’s permission to  
            bring my son? 

Daniel doesn’t answer. 

Jaakob understands what’s happening. 

                         JAAKOB 
            How much? 

                         DANIEL 
            Just a few shekels, really.  
            Perhaps, several?  

                         JAAKOB 
            Just a few shekels? Why not a few  
            denarii? 

                         DANIEL 
            That would be perfect. 

                         JAAKOB 
            What is your debt to me, already? 

                         DANIEL 
            A few shekels. Nothing, really.  

                         JAAKOB 
             I think not. It will come due.  
            Eventually. 

------------------55---------------

                                                                    5544.. 

                         DANIEL 
             I’ll have you paid off before you  
            know it. 

                         SILAS 
             ...what a waste... 

                         DANIEL 
            A waste? A waste? Why do you waste  
            your son here, Silas? 

                         SILAS 
            Oh, and what would you know? You  
            have no sons. You have no wife. 

                         DANIEL 
            Chava deserves better. 

                         SILAS 
            Who? A drunk like you??? 

The drunken Daniel lunges towards Silas. Jaakob intervenes. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Stop! Daniel! Silas! Enough. 

Jaakob counts out a few coins to Daniel. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Here. Take these. Go. 

                         SILAS 
                  (low) 
            Remember your place, Samaritan. 

Defiant, Daniel drinks from Silas’s cup at the table. Slams  
it down.  He turns and leaves. Zachary takes this all in.  
Silas stands to go after Daniel. Jaakob stops him. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Ignore him. 

INT. ROMAN STABLES - DAY 

Daniel blinks in the bright shafts of light in the stables as  
he finishes brushing a horse--a beautiful Arabian. Daniel  
nurses a headache. Hair beginning to gray, the now 50 yr-old  
Longinus, in the regalia of a Tribune, enters the stable.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Daniel?  

------------------56---------------

                                                                    5555.. 

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, Tribune. 

Longinus smells liquor on Daniel. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Again? 

                         DANIEL 
            What? No. I...was...helping  
             someone. A drunk in the street. He  
             stumbled and spilled wine on me.  

Longinus is no fool.  

                         LONGINUS 
             I have a duty to Rome and how she  
             is represented to Judea. 

Daniel swallows his pride. 

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, Tribune.  

                         LONGINUS  
             Come. Prepare the horses. I ride to  
             Caesarea.  

                         DANIEL 
            Yes. 

Daniel rushes to gather the tack for Longinus’s horse.  
Returning with saddle, bridle, etc. Longinus lingers; pre- 
occupied. 

                         LONGINUS 
            What do you think of Theron? 

                         DANIEL 
            All your horses are exceptional. 

                         LONGINUS 
            And you’ve done exceptional work  
            with him.  

                         DANIEL 
             Thank you, Tribune. 

                         LONGINUS 
                  (thoughtful) 
            My son...he had a way with horses.  

                         DANIEL 
            Your son? 

------------------57---------------

                                                                    5566.. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Yes.  

Daniel continues his work, unsure how to respond. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            He died while I was serving here.   

                         DANIEL 
             I am sorry, Tribune.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Rome and her gods require much. 

Daniel throws a black-fringed, red blanket over the horse’s  
back. Horse between them, Longinus changes subjects. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Daniel, what do you hear of this  
            new rabbi? 

                         DANIEL 
                  (working) 
             There are many rabbis.  

                         LONGINUS 
            People claim he performs miracles.  

                         DANIEL 
            One man’s miracle is another’s  
             drunken memory. 

Longinus laughs. 

                         LONGINUS 
             True words. They claim this one  
            turned water into wine. Fed  
            thousands of people when they had  
            no food. Heals the sick.  

                         DANIEL 
            Heals the sick? 

                         LONGINUS 
            Mmm, yes...  

Daniel ponders that thought. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             ...One of my Centurions claims he  
            healed his servant.  

                         DANIEL 
            What did your soldier say? 

------------------58---------------

                                                                    5577.. 

                         LONGINUS 
            He claims his servant was at  
             death’s door. Calls it a miracle.  
            He’s a good soldier.  

Daniel places the saddle over a curly-haired ram’s skin. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             They even say he’s raised the dead. 

                         DANIEL 
             Stories of miracles are a part of  
             life for Jews.  

                         LONGINUS 
             I’ve prayed to the Gods all my  
             life. Prayed for victory for the  
            Empire; for the defeat of her  
             enemies. For the lives of my  
            Legionnaires. Prayed for my son.  
            Prayed for that black demon Ferox  
            when he fell ill. 
                  (sad laugh) 
             I’ve seen no miracles.  

                         DANIEL 
             They are only stories. Stories that  
             come and go just like the rabbis  
             come and go.  

                         LONGINUS 
            But, a man that raised the dead?  
             That would change everything... 

Daniel has finished. He hands the reins to Longinus. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Well...let me know what you hear of  
            these stories and rabbis.  

                         DANIEL 
            Yes. 

Longinus mounts his horse. 

                         LONGINUS 
             I’ll be back in a few days. I  
             expect you to be ready.  

Longinus gives Daniel a stern, knowing look. 

------------------59---------------

                                                                    5588.. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Daniel...you have served me well  
             for more than 20 years. Don’t  
             jeopardize that by foolish choices. 

Daniel nods in compliance. Longinus rides off. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE STEPS 

Daniel and Caleb sit and eat bread, cucumbers, cheese and  
dates. Temple WORSHIPPERS, MERCHANTS, and SHOPPERS come and  
go creating a whirling, noisy scene.  

                         DANIEL 
             ...it must be the same lunatic the  
            Romans are talking about. 

                         CALEB 
             If you’d heard him, you wouldn’t  
             call him a lunatic. 

                         DANIEL 
            Lunatic, fanatic...call him  
            whatever you want. Caleb, how many  
             “prophets” have passed through this  
             square? 

                         CALEB 
             This one is different. He speaks  
            with power. The priests? You  
             should’ve heard the yelling and  
             screaming. The priests got so angry  
            they tried to stone him. 

                         DANIEL 
            What did he say? 

                         CALEB 
            He claimed he is “I am.” 

                         DANIEL 
             “I am.” What does that mean? 

                         CALEB 
             It’s blasphemy. He’s claiming to be  
            God who spoke to Moses on Mt Sinai! 

                         DANIEL 
             I was right. Lunatic. 

------------------60---------------

                                                                    5599.. 

                         CALEB 
            Daniel! Stop! Think about it. I was  
            there. I heard him. I...felt him.  
            What if he IS the Messiah? 

                         DANIEL 
             So, what? I don’t know how that  
            helps you, or me. 

                         CALEB 
            He said the truth would make us  
             free. While he was speaking, I  
            didn’t care if I was blind or  
             crippled. 

                         DANIEL 
             It will take more than the truth to  
             free us from the Romans. Prophets  
            never bring good news. They just  
             cause trouble. Better to be alive  
             and with food in your belly than  
             free and dead.  

Daniel wipes his hands together and stands up. 

                         CALEB 
            Where are you going? 

                         DANIEL 
            Nowhere. 

                         CALEB 
            You are the one who is going to  
             cause trouble.  

                         DANIEL 
             Spare me the lecture.  

Daniel heads into the gathering dusk. Caleb shakes his head. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE MOUNT - EVENING 

Daniel is, once again, gambling. Daniel seems to be holding  
his own at this game of chance. In the b.g., A CROWD  
surrounds an unseen SPEAKER. More PEOPLE gather. Daniel and  
the GAMBLERS pay no heed.  

                         GAMBLER #2 
            Come on, finish! 

Daniel throws...And, once again, loses. The Gamblers gladly  
take his money. Daniel shakes his head in frustration.  

------------------61---------------

                                                                    6600.. 

                         GAMBLER #3 
             One more game! 

                         DANIEL 
            No. No. I’m finished.  

Daniel leaves the Gamblers and heads toward the crowd, sly  
look on his face.  

As Daniel works into the crowd, the words of the Speaker are  
more distinct. 

                         SPEAKER O.C. 
             Correct. Do this and you will live. 

Daniel looks for listeners careless with their belongings. He  
carefully, sneakily, reaches into a bag laying at someone’s  
feet, slips a few coins out and into his hand.  

Another person’s voice is heard... 

                         LAWYER O.C. 
            And, who is my neighbor? 

The Speaker continues as Daniel pays no attention, pleased  
with his take. He looks for another victim. 

                         SPEAKER O.C. 
            A man went down from Jerusalem to  
             Jericho, and was ambushed by  
             thieves who stripped him, beat him,  
             and left him half-dead... 

Daniel spies an OLD MAN who looks like an easy mark. 

                         SPEAKER O.C. (CONT’D) 
             By chance, a priest saw the injured  
            man. But, crossed the road and  
             passed by on the other side. 

Daniel stands next to the Old Man and pretends to listen.  

                         SPEAKER O.C. (CONT’D) 
             Likewise, a Levite saw the man and  
             passed by on the other side. 

Daniel slides a hand into the Old Man’s satchel. 

                         SPEAKER O.C. (CONT’D) 
             But, then, a Samaritan came by... 

At the word, “Samaritan,” Daniel looks at the Speaker.  

------------------62---------------

                                                                    6611.. 

                         SPEAKER O.C. (CONT’D) 
            When the Samaritan saw the injured  
            man, he felt great compassion. He  
             tended to his wounds and lifted the  
            man onto his donkey and carried him  
             to an inn... 

Daniel moves forward trying to get a glimpse of the Speaker.  

                         SPEAKER O.C. (CONT’D) 
             The Samaritan gave the Innkeeper  
             two pence and charged him to care  
             for the injured traveler promising  
             to pay any expenses... 

Daniel makes his way to the edge of the crowd. 

                         SPEAKER  
            Now, which of the three was a  
             neighbor to the victim of the  
             thieves? 

The Lawyer responds. 

                         LAWYER 
             The last one. The one who showed  
            mercy. 

The Speaker rises as if to leave and smiles as he surveys the  
crowd. He locks eyes with Daniel. 

                         SPEAKER  
             Go. And do the same.  

Daniel becomes self-conscious but can’t look away. The  
Speaker walks toward the temple. The Crowd rushes to follow.   

Daniel is deep in thought as the Crowd pushes past. He turns  
and walks the other direction. 

Unseen in the Crowd and out of uniform, Longinus watches the  
Crowd follow after Jesus. Tentatively, he follows. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - DAY 

The normal coming and goings surround the Fortress. VENDORS  
sell to SOLDIERS. PROTESTORS rail against the Roman  
occupation. And, Daniel; waiting for Longinus’s return.  

A troop of FOOT SOLDIERS followed by mounted LEGIONNAIRES,  
including Longinus, appears in a cloud of dust. Daniel passes  
two WOUNDED LEGIONNAIRES carried on litters.  

------------------63---------------

                                                                    6622.. 

Daniel hurries up to take the reins of Longinus’s mount--a  
brown Arabian.  

Longinus’s Optio goes to the wounded as Longinus dismounts. 

                         LONGINUS    
             Tell Galen to make ready. We’ll  
             need all his surgeon’s skills. 

Optio salutes. LITTER BEARERS carry the wounded after him. 

                         DANIEL 
            What happened? Theron? 

                         LONGINUS 
            We were attacked by a cowardly  
             rabble a few miles from the city.  

Daniel’s concern grows, anticipating what this could mean.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             Theron was hit by two arrows. I’ll  
            have my Optio send Quintus to meet  
            you in the stables. Care for him  
            while I see to my wounded. Then,  
             come to me. I have a task for you.   

Holding the reins, Daniel nods as Longinus heads after the  
Litter Bearers.  

Daniel walks along the line of dusty men, wagons, and  
animals.  

Theron, head low is being walked by a CENTURION. Two bloody  
gashes between his ribs ooze bright blood. 

Daniel quickly trades reins with the Centurion. He carefully  
turns Theron towards the stables. 

INT. ROMAN STABLES - DAY 

Gently, Daniel urges Theron along. The horse falters and then  
slumps to the ground. QUINTUS, the Veteranerius Medicus, a  
cavalry officer charged with caring for the medical needs of  
the horses, arrives at the same time. Rushes to the horse.   

INT. LONGINUS'S QUARTERS - LATER 

Head bowed, Longinus kneels before a small shrine comprised  
of miniature statues of Roman gods. Furrowed brow and grimace  
indicate his anguish. A servant hastily enters. 

------------------64---------------

                                                                    6633.. 

                         SERVANT 
             Tribune. 

Longinus rises quickly and follows the Servant. 

INT. ROMAN STABLES - MOMENTS LATER 

A concerned Longinus arrives to see his horse struggling.  
Hands bloody, Quintus grimly looks at Longinus.   

                         QUINTUS 
             His lungs, Tribune. The arrows  
             punctured his lungs.  

Longinus lays a shaking hand on the flank of his battle  
companion.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Even when wounded, he never  
             faltered; never wavered. 

                         DANIEL 
             Can’t you do something? 

Quintus shakes his head. Daniel is heart-sick. Longinus,  
pained at the news, but maintaining the stoicism of a Roman  
Tribune, gives a short nod to Quintus.  

Quintus draws his short sword. Longinus stops him, takes the  
sword from his hands and moves to Theron. Daniel reaches  
towards the sword.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Let me, Tribune. 

Longinus shakes his head, no. 

With a courageous breath, he dutifully puts his horse out of  
its misery himself.  

                         LONGINUS 
            No miracle today. 

INT. LONGINUS’S QUARTERS - LATER 

Daniel is allowed entrance. Longinus holds a purple cloak and  
a sword with an ornate eagle hilt. He stares into the  
distance, the slaying of his faithful horse still weighs on  
him.  Daniel remains silent. Long moments pass. 

                         DANIEL 
             I am so very sorry, Tribune. 

------------------65---------------

                                                                    6644.. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Your offer was much appreciated. 

                         DANIEL 
             It is hard thing. 

                         LONGINUS 
             You loved him even more than I.  

Longinus pauses, emotions still close to the surface.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             You have been a good...friend,  
             Daniel.  

                         DANIEL 
             I don’t know what to say, Tribune.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Say nothing. No one should hear a  
             Tribune speaking so to a Hebrew. 

Longinus straightens himself and changes the subject. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             I’ve been promoted. Tribunus  
            Laticlavius.   

                         DANIEL 
             Congratulations.  

                         LONGINUS 
                  (hollow) 
             I am to have a staff. 

Daniel isn’t sure where this is going.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             You are now my personal attendant.  

Daniel is unsure. 

                         DANIEL 
             Yes, Tribune. 

Longinus straightens himself; tries to shake off the pain of  
losing his horse. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Come, the task I mentioned... 

Longinus leads Daniel from his quarters. 

------------------66---------------

                                                                    6655.. 

As they leave, they pass the shrine. All of the statues of  
the gods are gone. 

EXT. VALETUDINARIUM - SAME 

Longinus exits the rear door of the building. Daniel follows.  
There, wrapped in bloody rags is a body.  

                         LONGINUS 
                  (controlled anger) 
             One of the rebels who attacked us.  

                         DANIEL 
            What do you want from me? 

                         LONGINUS 
            Find the dead man’s family. Tell  
            them that while my horse will be  
             remembered with honor, this will be  
            thrown on the rotting heap at  
            Golgotha.  

Daniel approaches the body; pulls back the rags. Silas. 

Daniel stifles his reaction. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             See that it is done.  

Daniel can only nod. 

EXT. CHAVA AND SILAS’S HOME - NIGHT 

Chava’s Parents, Zachary, Jaakob, and FRIENDS attend to the  
anxious and frightened Chava. The failure of the raid and  
Silas’s fate weigh heavily on everyone. 

Reluctantly, Daniel approaches. Zachary sees him and runs to  
him. The others wait nervously. Jaakob steps forward. Chava  
shakily approaches.  

                         ZACHARY 
            Daniel! Daniel!  

Daniel puts a hand on Zachary’s shoulder as they reach the  
low wall in front of Chava’s home. She looks pleadingly. 

                         DANIEL 
             Chava, I am sorry. Silas is dead.  

Chava puts on a brave face but tears flow. Anger and sadness  
combine as she lunges at Jaakob. 

------------------67---------------

                                                                    6666.. 

                         CHAVA 
             You! You did this! 

She pounds Jaakob’s chest as he pushes her aside. She is  
shattered. Daniel moves to her. 

                         DANIEL 
             Chava...I am sorry. 

He lifts her up and holds her briefly as her Parents take   
her and help her back into the house.  Zachary is seething.  

                         ZACHARY 
             I’ll kill them. I’ll kill the first  
             Roman I see! 

Zachary dissolves in bitter tears. 

                         DANIEL 
             Zachary!!! And make your mother  
             face death twice? Now you must be  
             strong for your mother. Your  
             priority is not vengeance for your  
             father. It is care for your mother.  

Zachary wipes his face and turns towards the house.  

When Zachary is inside, Daniel wheels on Jaakob. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Satisfied?? 

                         JAAKOB 
             Silas knew the price of freedom.  

                         DANIEL 
             Silas? Silas???  What about  
             Zachary? What about Chava!!?? 

                         JAAKOB 
            We all pay the price living under  
             the Roman heel.  

                         DANIEL 
                  (laughing) 
             You paid no price! You sent your  
             sister’s husband to his death. It  
             should’ve been you. 

Daniel leaves.  

                         JAAKOB 
             Better a dead patriot than a slave  
             of the Romans! 

------------------68---------------

                                                                    6677.. 

Daniel turns back to give Jaakob the beating he deserves.  

Enraged, Daniel hauls back to strike him. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Go ahead. But, remember your place;  
            your debts to me.  

The words stop Daniel. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             It doesn’t have to be this way. I  
             can make things worse...or, better.  
            Your choice. 

Daniel shoves Jaakob hard and storms away.  

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE STEPS - NIGHT 

The temple entrance and courtyard are quiet. A torch  
illuminates a weary, sad Daniel. He counsels with Caleb.  

                         CALEB 
             ...That’s right. He was a terrible  
            husband and father. And I’m only  
            repeating what you have told me  
            yourself. 

Daniel remains silent. His mind reeling with the day’s events  
and the possible ramifications.  

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Now. The question that must be  
             asked: Why not...you? 

                         DANIEL 
            What do you mean?  

                         CALEB 
            Don’t be stupid. 

                         DANIEL 
            Her husband hasn’t been dead a day! 

                         CALEB 
             So, what!? She is alone! She has a  
             son! At some point she must  
            remarry.  Silas had no brothers.  
            WHY NOT YOU!? 

                         DANIEL 
            Why not??? Why not??? 

------------------69---------------

                                                                    6688.. 

Daniel rebels against the truth of Caleb’s statement and the  
fear of the truth in his own heart. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I am a Samaritan. A Samaritan,  
             Caleb. I am employed by the Romans.  
             I’m an outcast. I might as well be  
             a leper. I have nothing to offer.   

Daniel calms. Resigned to the reality. 

                         CALEB 
             But, you love her. You’ve always  
             loved her. 

                         DANIEL 
             Her life with me would be misery.  

Daniel tries to convince himself. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Someday, her pain will subside.  
             Someone else will offer her a  
             better life. The life she deserves.  

                         CALEB 
            Are you done feeling sorry for  
            yourself?  

                         DANIEL 
                  (angry) 
            Enough! 

Daniel slouches away. 

                         CALEB 
                  (calling after) 
             In the mean time, What is to become  
             of Zachary? Leave him to Jaakob?  
             That will end well, won’t it!? 

Caleb seats himself, muttering as he wraps a threadbare  
blanket around himself. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             Fool...plain as the nose on his  
             face...Someone else will offer her  
             a better life... 

EXT. JERUSALEM, STREETS - EARLY MORNING 

Daniel wanders the streets, alone with his thoughts. Sleep  
has escaped him this turbulent night.  

------------------70---------------

                                                                    6699.. 

He watches as the city awakens. VENDORS, MERCHANTS, MOTHERS,  
FATHERS, CHILDREN, PRIESTS, all begin the new day.  

Daniel passes a small window in a stucco wall. Familiar words  
stop him in his tracks. He listens as he hears a MOTHER and  
FATHER lead their CHILDREN in the Shema.  

     MOTHER AND FATHER O.C.                      CHILDREN O.C. 
Hear, O Israel,: The Lord,             Hear, O Israel,: The Lord,  
our God, the Lord is one)              our God, the Lord is one) 
    (whispered)                           (whispered) 
Blessed is the name of His             Blessed is the name of His  
glorious kingdom for eternity          glorious kingdom for eternity 
    (aloud)                               (aloud) 
You shall love the Lord your           You shall love the Lord your  
God with all your heart and            God with all your heart and  
with all your soul and with            with all your soul and with  
all your might...                      all your might... 

From somewhere inside, Daniel remembers the words and repeats  
them along with the unseen family. 

                         DANIEL 
             ...with all your heart and with all  
            your soul and with all your  
            might... 

Daniel stifles a tear and forces back the emotion and memory. 

INT. JERUSALEM, TAVERN - NIGHT 

Rowdy, noisy DRUNKARDS in full revelry surround Daniel. But,  
he is thoroughly alone. He stares at a cup of wine. He wants  
nothing more than to forget his troubles, but...he tosses a  
coin to the BARKEEP and walks out. The wine...untouched.  

INT. CAESAREA MARITIMA, ROMAN HEADQUARTERS - DAY  

In the military headquarters of the region, Longinus meets  
with the regional commander, the LEGATUS LEGIONIS.  

                         LONGINUS 
             ...it was a minor skirmish. Not  
             even that. 

                         LEGATUS 
             Injuries, deaths. That is not the  
            point. The point is that it  
             happened at all.  

------------------71---------------

                                                                    7700.. 

The Legatus lets that sink in.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Yes, Legatus.  

                         LEGATUS 
            What do you know of this street  
            preacher, Jesus? 

                         LONGINUS 
            He is a carpenter from Nazareth.  
            He’s a nobody--not unlike one of a  
            thousand self-styled saviors who is  
            here today and gone tomorrow. 

                         LEGATUS 
            What happens if he connects with  
            these rebels attacking your troops,  
            Tribune? 

                         LONGINUS 
             It would be unfortunate for anyone  
            to challenge the Emperor, Legatus.  

                         LEGATUS 
            And by “unfortunate,” I’m sure you  
            mean fatal?  

                         LONGINUS 
            Of course.  

                         LEGATUS 
            Religious zealots. Political  
             zealots...The Emperor cannot afford  
             such disruptions. I cannot afford  
             such disruptions. You...cannot  
             afford such disruptions.  

                         LONGINUS 
            No, Legatus. 

                         LEGATUS 
             I understand you have a Jew in your  
            employ. 

                         LONGINUS 
            There are many Jews who do the  
            menial work to maintain Fortress  
            Antonia. 

                         LEGATUS 
                  (cold) 
            Are there.  

------------------72---------------

                                                                    7711.. 

The Legatus leaves Longinus standing for a few moments to re- 
enforce his message and make sure Longinus knows his place.  

                         LEGATUS (CONT’D) 
             Dismissed. 

Longinus salutes and leaves. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, CHAVA’S HOME - DAY 

Daniel sits outside the door of Chava’s home. Zachary sits  
beside him, face sullen. 

                         DANIEL 
             Yes, he is your uncle. You owe him  
             respect, yes. But, you don’t owe  
             him your life.  

Zachary is silent. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             This isn’t a game. When you are  
             caught, not if; when...The Romans  
            will make an example out of  
             you...you’ve seen what they do.  

Zachary is unmoved. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             ...they’ll crucify you and it won’t  
             change anything. It will only put  
             your mother in danger.  

Without a word, Zachary stands and leaves. Daniel is  
confused. He stands, not knowing what to do. 

Chava appears at the door.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I’m sorry. I guess he’s still in a  
             lot of pain.  

                         CHAVA 
             He’s very angry.  

                         DANIEL 
             That’s understandable. Everyone has  
             reason to be angry at the Romans.  

                         CHAVA 
             He’s angry at you. 

Daniel is shocked. 

------------------73---------------

                                                                    7722.. 

                         DANIEL 
            Me? Why? 

Chava is angry as well; and sad and torn. 

                         CHAVA 
            You work for his father’s  
            murderers. 

                         DANIEL 
                  (defensive) 
            No...no. I was only trying to help  
            him... 

Chava’s grief speaks cutting words. 

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel. You take money from the  
            monsters who enslave our people and  
            killed my husband. Have you no  
             shame? The murderers of your  
            people... 

                         DANIEL 
                  (angry, sarcastic) 
            My people...my people??!!  You mean  
            the people who took me in as an  
            orphan?  Or, the people who gave me  
             food when I was hungry and had no  
            one??  Or, all the people who  
             stopped to help me when my mother  
            was killed??? The only people who  
            have ever, ever given me anything  
             are the Romans. I’m a Samaritan! My  
             “people” have only ever wished me  
            dead. I have no people!  

Chava is in tears. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I’m sorry Silas is dead. I’m... 

Daniel recognizes the futility. He leaves. 

Chava, realizes, too late, the finality of the situation. 

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel! 

------------------74---------------

                                                                    7733.. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - DAY 

Daniel holds the reins of Longinus’s horse in front of the  
Fortress. SOLDIERS come and go. Longinus approaches being  
hectored by a chattering group of PHARISEES. 

                         LONGINUS 
            What has he said against Rome? 

The Pharisees are caught for an answer.  

                         PHARISEE #2 
            But, their numbers are growing. 

                         PHARISEE #1 
            Who knows where his zealots are  
            hiding.  

Longinus takes the reins from Daniel. 

                         PHARISEE #2 
             They could be anywhere.  

Pharisee #3 sees Daniel. 

                         PHARISEE #3 
            Even this man here, could be one of  
            these agitators. 

Longinus mounts his horse.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Daniel...are you a disciple of  
             Jesus agitating against Rome? 

                         DANIEL 
            No, Tribune.  

Frustrated, Longinus dismisses the Pharisees. 

                         LONGINUS  
             I am aware of this Jesus and will  
             continue to watch his activities.  

                         PHARISEE #1 
             If this man is agitating against  
            Rome, the consequences would be  
             severe. We are only trying to avoid  
             such a disruption.  

                         LONGINUS 
            We are finished.  

The Pharisees disburse, arguing among themselves.  

------------------75---------------

                                                                    7744.. 

Longinus watches them leave. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Do you still believe this street  
            preacher will amount to nothing? 

                         DANIEL 
             I don’t know, Tribune. He probably  
            will make at least as many enemies  
             as he will friends.  

                         LONGINUS 
             It appears he already has a good  
             start on enemies. What have you  
            heard of him?  

                         DANIEL 
             I saw him preach.  

                         LONGINUS 
            And...? 

                         DANIEL 
            He said that everyone is my  
            neighbor and that we must be kind  
            to all.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Truly the words of a violent  
             revolutionary. What do you know of  
            the rebels who attacked my troops?  

                         DANIEL 
            Nothing, Tribune.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Come now. There must be talk in the  
            markets.  

                         DANIEL 
             I’m a Samaritan. I take pay from  
            the Romans. No one talks to me  
             about such things, Tribune. 

Longinus pauses. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Being a disciple of a harmless  
            vagabond preacher is one thing.  
            But, to discover that you had  
            thrown in with the enemies of  
            Rome... 

Daniel is now silent. 

------------------76---------------

                                                                    7755.. 

                         LONGINUS  (CONT’D) 
             I would not threaten you, Daniel. I  
             am pleading.  

Longinus rides off. 

EXT. ACROSS FROM FORTRESS ANTONIA - SAME 

Crouched in an alcove, Jaakob watches unseen. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, STREETS - LATER 

Daniel carries food. As he walks, Jaakob steps alongside.  
Daniel keeps walking. 

                         DANIEL 
             Jaakob. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Daniel. I need your help, old  
             friend.  

Daniel stops and looks at Jaakob with a questioning look on  
his face. He keeps walking. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             I need to know what’s going on in  
            the Fortress. 

Daniel keeps moving. Jaakob tries cajoling. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            A small thing. Help the cause and  
            you can erase your past.  

Daniel doesn’t slow.  

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Your debts. Gone. Prove your  
             loyalty to your people and no one  
            needs to know of your heritage.  

Jaakob is sincere. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Daniel, come now. We were friends  
             once? 

Jaakob now starts using leverage. 

------------------77---------------

                                                                     7766.. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             Whoever wants to step in and care  
             for Chava must have my approval.  

Daniel stops. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             I know, Daniel.  

Daniel walks again. He doesn’t dare hope. 

Jaakob grabs Daniel’s arm and stops him.  

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             Help me and I will help you. 

                         DANIEL 
             Help me? What about Zachary and  
             Chava? Don’t you see what you’ve  
             done to them? 

                         JAAKOB 
             Daniel, this is bigger than them. 

                         DANIEL 
             Is this what you’ve become? This is  
             what you are? You’d sacrifice your  
             own family? 

                         JAAKOB 
             Others have sacrificed more. 

                         DANIEL 
             For what?! 

                         JAAKOB 
             For God! God requires we sacrifice  
             everything.  

Daniel can’t believe he’s hearing this. Jaakob’s demeanor  
begins to change. 

                         DANIEL 
             Silas? Zachary? Chava? You’re  
             willing to sacrifice everyone else.  
             I want nothing to do with a God  
             that asks for that kind of  
             sacrifice. You blame it on  
             God...You’re a coward. 

                         JAAKOB 
             I do not care what you think of me.  
             What I do is more important than  
             me, than you, than my family.  
                          (MORE)(MORE)

                                                                      7777.. 

                          JAAKOB (CONT’D)JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             This fight has gone on for  
             centuries and will continue until  
             God delivers His children. And no  
             one, least of all you, can stop it.  

They stare each other down. 

                          JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             Daniel. If you don’t help  
             me...Zachary will feel it. Chava  
             will feel it.  

Jaakob brushes by Daniel. 

                          JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             Meet me here tomorrow and give me  
             your answer.  

Jaakob walks away, turns back and pushes up close to Daniel. 

                          JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             I would place every man, woman, and  
             child in this city on the altar.   
             Do not doubt me, old friend.  

Jaakob leaves. Daniel calls after him. 

                          DANIEL 
             Jaakob...we are not friends. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, MARKETPLACE - LATER 

Deep in thought, Daniel wanders in a daze through the  
brightly colored, noisy market.  

As he plods between the silks and linens, the spices and  
breads, he passes a MERCHANT selling bracelets, gold  
trinkets, other jewelry.  

Daniel’s vacant gaze is caught by a glossy glow. He looks  
closer...two small, pearl ear rings.  

The MERCHANT notices Daniel’s interest in the jewelry. 

                          MERCHANT 
             They are exquisite, are they not?  
             What better way to show one’s  
             love???  

Daniel thinks about all that those ear rings could mean.  
Shakes his head and walks away.  

After a few paces, he sighs, and returns to the merchant. 

------------------79---------------

                                                                    7788.. 

                         DANIEL 
             How much? 

EXT. ACROSS FROM FORTRESS ANTONIA - DAY 

Jaakob warily waits for Daniel. PEOPLE and SOLDIERS pass by.  
Jaakob grows anxious.  

A hand grabs Jaakob from behind, pulling him into a shadow  
out of sight of the Fortress. Daniel shoves Jaakob hard  
against the wall. 

                         DANIEL 
             One condition... 

                         JAAKOB 
             You are not... 

                         DANIEL 
             One condition! You swear an oath  
             that you will leave Zachary and  
             Chava alone. Alone! Swear it! 

Jaakob hesitates. Daniel begins to drag Jaakob towards the  
Fortress. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Let me introduce you to my Roman  
             friends. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Alright! Alright! 

Daniel spins him around.  

                         DANIEL 
            An oath! Swear it! 

                         JAAKOB 
             On my life, I swear it. Zachary and  
             Chava will not be involved.  

                         DANIEL 
             Swear it! Again! 

                         JAAKOB 
             I swear! 

Daniel pushes Jaakob aside. Daniel breathes heavily.  

------------------80---------------

                                                                    7799.. 

                         DANIEL 
             There have been messengers at the  
            Fortress from Caesarea. Something  
             is happening.  

                         JAAKOB 
            What? 

                         DANIEL 
             I’ll find you when I know anymore. 

He looks hard at Jaakob. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I have your oath. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE MOUNT - EVENING 

Daniel walks past the area where the PRIESTS are officiating.  
A lamb has been slaughtered and a Priest places blood on the  
four corners of the altar.  

Daniel glances at the altar. He opens his hand and stares at  
the two pearl ear rings in his palm. He keeps walking. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE MOUNT - LATER 

As the smoke from the burnt offerings wafts into the  
darkening sky, Daniel explains his problems to Caleb. 

                         DANIEL 
             ...No one will believe me. 

                         CALEB 
             Tell Chava. 

                         DANIEL 
             I tried. 

                         CALEB 
             Tell the Tribune.  

                         DANIEL 
             I can’t do that to him. Word gets  
             out that a friend of a Jewish rebel  
            works in his house...he’d be  
             ruined. He’d have no choice but to  
             execute Jaakob and everyone he’s  
             close to. Parents, Zachary. You.  
             Chava. Me? 

------------------81---------------

                                                                    8800.. 

The seriousness of the situation settles over them.  Daniel  
takes the pearl earrings out of a small leather pouch.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I should leave. 

                         CALEB 
            What? Why? 

Daniel rolls the earrings in his palm--staring at them.  

                         DANIEL 
            As long as I’m here, Jaakob will  
            hold Chava over me.  

                         CALEB 
            He wouldn’t hurt his sister. 

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, he would. But, if I leave,  
            Chava is safe. 

                         CALEB 
            He’ll hunt you down. Your debts. 

                         DANIEL 
            Maybe if I give him some piece of  
             information about the Romans,  
             something, maybe that will satisfy  
            him and he won’t try to find me.  

                         CALEB 
            Maybe you’ll be more valuable once  
            he sees he can manipulate you. 

                         DANIEL 
            That’s a chance I guess I’ll have  
            to take.  

                         CALEB 
            Where will you go?? 

Daniel shrugs his shoulders. Thinks in silence. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            You belong here. 

                         DANIEL 
            No. No. I don’t belong anywhere.  

He tucks the earrings back in the pouch. 

------------------82---------------

                                                                    8811.. 

INT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - DAY 

The Fortress is alive with activity. LEGIONNAIRES move with  
purpose gathering armor. SERVANTS scurry about. Longinus  
gives orders as Daniel helps him with his armor.  

                         LONGINUS 
             ...before I return, see that the  
             stables are cleaned and cleared. We  
            will need the space.  

                         DANIEL 
            How much space? 

                         LONGINUS 
             Space for several wagon-loads of  
            materiel. Double up the horses.  

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, Tribune. 

Daniel finishes with the armor. Longinus, Daniel, and the  
Optio move outside. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - SAME 

LEGIONNAIRES stand in squads. Longinus mounts his waiting  
horse as does the Optio.  

                         LONGINUS 
            We’ll return from Caesarea in six  
             days. See that all is ready. 

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, Tribune. 

                         LONGINUS 
             This animal isn’t as steady as  
             Theron. Can he be trusted?  

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, Tribune. He has heart and will  
            not let you down.  

                         LONGINUS 
             I hope so.   

                         DANIEL 
            Return in safety, Tribune. 

The Optimus signals the men to move out. Longinus rides to  
lead the column followed by STANDARD BEARERS and SCOUTS.  

------------------83---------------

                                                                    8822.. 

Conflicted, by what he must do, Daniel watches as the  
Soldiers move out. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, ALLEY - NIGHT 

Daniel follows Jaakob as they carefully walk through a dark  
alley. They duck into a small entrance. 

INT. SECRET MEETING PLACE - SAME 

A REBEL leads Daniel and Jaakob up a narrow stairway and to  
an upper room. There, candles illuminate three more REBELS,  
including a wild-eyed, evil-looking, BARABBAS. 

                         BARABBAS 
             Tell us what you know. 

Daniel starts speaking but, BARABBAS interrupts him. 

                         BARABBAS (CONT’D) 
             But, remember...if you lie to us,  
            you’ll die. 

                         DANIEL 
                  (anxious) 
             The Legion at Antonia, has mustered  
             fifty men. They left yesterday. 

                         BARABBAS 
             Fifty men.  

                         DANIEL 
             They are headed to the garrison at  
             Caesarea Maritima. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Keep talking. 

                         DANIEL 
             I was told to clear the stables to  
            make room for wagons when they  
             return. 

                         BARABBAS 
            What are they bringing back? 

                         DANIEL 
             I don’t know. There was no talk of  
             the cargo in front of any of us. 

                         BARABBAS 
             In front of the slaves? 

------------------84---------------

                                                                    8833.. 

Daniel holds his tongue.  

                         JAAKOB 
             Could be food, supplies, weapons? 

Daniel shrugs. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            What next? 

                         BARABBAS 
             Send someone to follow these  
             soldiers. Once they reach Maritima  
             and see what is being carried, have  
             them report. We will need to be  
             ready.  

                         JAAKOB 
            We’ll be ready, Barabbas. 

Jaakob motions to Daniel and they leave.  

EXT. SECRET MEETING PLACE - NIGHT 

Jaakob makes sure the coast is clear. Daniel has no fear of  
Jaakob now. 

                         DANIEL 
             Remember your oath. You leave  
             Zachary and Chava alone. 

                         JAAKOB 
             If you’re lying, Samaritan, you  
             die.  

                         DANIEL 
             Break your oath, and you die.  

Disgusted, Daniel leaves. 

EXT. JAAKOB’S TANNERY - DAY 

Wearing a leather apron and surrounded by tanning vats,  
Jaakob hands Zachary a small satchel and a wine skin. Zachary  
holds a staff. He’s prepared for a journey. 

                         JAAKOB 
             ...do not get any closer than you  
             have to. 

                         ZACHARY 
             I understand. 

------------------85---------------

                                                                    8844.. 

                         JAAKOB 
             The Romans headed out a day ago.  
            But, they are weighed down with  
             armor and equipment. You should  
             catch them by mid-day tomorrow.  

Zachary nods. 

                         ZACHARY 
            Mother knows? 

                         JAAKOB 
             This was her idea. She hates the  
            Romans even more than you do. 

Jaakob guides Zachary up the road.  

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
             Stay on the main road to Caesarea.  
            Don’t talk to anyone. If someone  
             asks, your name is Benjamin. You’re  
             going to Caesarea to look for work.  

Zachary nods, nervously. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Once you have found the Romans and  
             see what they are doing there, come  
            back as quickly as you can.  

                         ZACHARY 
            Alright. 

Jaakob stops Zachary. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Zachary. Your revenge starts here.  

Zachary sets off at a run. 

EXT. CHAVA AND SILAS’ HOME - DAY 

Chava’s voice can be heard from inside. 

                         CHAVA O.C. 
             Zachary? 

Chava comes outside. 

                         CHAVA 
             Zachary!? 

Concern on her face. 

------------------86---------------

                                                                    8855.. 

EXT. JAAKOB'S TANNERY - DAY 

An anxious Chava sees Jaakob. She rushes to them.   

                         CHAVA 
             Jaakob! Have you seen Zachary? I  
             can’t find him. 

Jaakob lies convincingly.  

                         JAAKOB 
             Calm down. I sent him to Hebron to  
             buy several goat skins for me. He  
             told me he’d gotten permission from  
            you. 

                         CHAVA 
            No! No! He said nothing. That’s not  
             like him. 

                         JAAKOB 
             He’ll be back in a day or two. The  
             road is well traveled.  

                         CHAVA 
            Why didn’t you go with him? 

                         JAAKOB 
             Chava. He’ll be fine. Stop  
            worrying. Go home.  

                         CHAVA 
             If he brings the skins to you  
             first, you send him straight home. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Yes. Of course.  

Chava, still unsettled, leaves. 

INT. DANIEL’S QUARTERS - EVENING 

Daniel gathers his few belongings. He places them in a  
leather satchel and cautiously exits his room. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - EVENING 

Daniel, head down, avoiding people, steps through the crowd.  
As he gets to the bottom of the stairs, he hears a voice... 

                         CHAVA O.C. 
             Daniel! Daniel! 

------------------87---------------

                                                                    8866.. 

Surprised by Chava, Daniel grabs her arm and rushes her away  
from the Fortress. 

                         DANIEL 
            What are you doing here??!! 

                         CHAVA 
             I can’t find Zachary. Jaakob says  
            he’s gone to Hebron, but I don’t  
            believe him. 

                         DANIEL 
            Hebron? How long has he been gone? 

                         CHAVA 
             Since yesterday.  

                         DANIEL 
            Everything will be alright. I’ll  
             find Zachary.   

Chava cries harder. Daniel reaches out and puts an arm around  
her. Then, turns her to face him. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Head home. Stay away from Jaakob.  
             I’ll send word as soon as I find  
             Zachary.  

Chava wipes away her tears and nods her head. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             It’ll be alright.  

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel. Thank you.  

Daniel nods. Chava hugs him close and then turns for home. 

Daniel looks around trying to figure out what to do. He heads  
back into the Fortress. 

INT. SECRET MEETING PLACE - NIGHT 

Jaakob and Barabbas are in the middle of an intense  
conversation.  

                         BARABBAS 
            You said he could be trusted. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Something has happened. He’s either  
            dead, captured, or run away. 

------------------88---------------

                                                                    8877.. 

                         BARABBAS 
             This is on your head! 

                         JAAKOB 
             Fine! But, the Romans will beat you  
             to it if we don’t move. And...I  
            won’t be the only one who’s head is  
             in danger. 

                         BARABBAS 
            Warn the others. Meet beyond the  
             Fish Gate after sundown.  

EXT. JERUSALEM, GOLDEN GATE - DAY 

Longinus rides at the head of his troops as they enter the  
city through the eastern gate. Many PEOPLE run back and forth  
through the main street. Everywhere, palm fronds cover the  
ground.  A REVELER runs by carrying fronds in each hand. 

                         REVELER 
             Blessed is he who comes in the name  
             of the Lord! Hosanna! 

Voices are heard shouting, “King of Kings!” “The Deliverer!”  
Other CELEBRANTS follow after the Reveler with the fronds.  

                         LONGINUS 
             You! You! Stop! 

A pair of Soldiers reach out and stop the Celebrants. They  
are nervous at being stopped by Romans. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             Have no fear. What has happened  
             here today? 

The Celebrants look nervously at each other.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             Speak. Freely. 

                         CELEBRANT 
             The King has come. 

                         LONGINUS 
             King? There is no king but Caesar. 

                         CELEBRANT 
             Jesus. The prophet from Galilee. 

------------------89---------------

                                                                    8888.. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Jesus. 
                  (to Soldiers) 
             Let them go. 

The Celebrants run on their way. Grimly, Longinus moves his  
column forward. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            Move out. 

As the column marches by, several loaded wagons covered by  
tarps follow the Soldiers. Bringing up the rear is a limping  
young man bound in chains...Zachary. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - DAY 

The dusty column arrives at the Fortress. Daniel quickly  
approaches Longinus taking the reins of his horse. The Optio  
arrives just behind Daniel. Longinus is unusually cold. 

                         DANIEL 
            Welcome, Tribune. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Are the stables ready? 

                         DANIEL 
             Yes. Shall I organize the wagons? 

                         LONGINUS 
             Yes. Optio, see to the prisoner. 

Daniel reacts to knowledge of a prisoner. 

                         OPTIO 
             Right away, Tribune. 

Longinus dismounts and heads inside, ignoring Daniel. 

Daniel sends the horse with another Servant. He walks past  
the Soldiers as they fall out. The wagons are at the rear.  
Daniel gives orders. 

                         DANIEL 
             Drive them inside. We’ll unload  
             after the horses are cared for. 

As Daniel moves the wagons inside, the Optio passes and meets  
the rear guard including a bound Zachary.  

Daniel is stunned and covers his shock. The exhausted Zachary  
is unaware of Daniel as the Optio pushes him along.  

------------------90---------------

                                                                     8899.. 

INT. FORTRESS ANTONIA, CELL - DAY 

Inside the dingy cell, Zachary huddles in a corner; tired,  
hungry, in pain. Daniel approaches the bars of the cell. 

                         DANIEL 
             Zachary. 

Zachary looks up through a black and swollen eye.  

                         ZACHARY 
                  (relief) 
             Daniel!  

                         DANIEL 
             Zachary, what happened? 

                         ZACHARY 
             I was watching as they loaded the  
             wagons. I got too close.  

                         DANIEL 
             Did Jaakob send you?  

                         ZACHARY 
             Yes. I didn’t tell them anything.   
             What’s going to happen to me?  

                         DANIEL 
             I don’t know.  

                         ZACHARY 
             Daniel? 

                         DANIEL 
             I’ll talk to the Tribune. 

                         ZACHARY 
             I’m scared.  

                         DANIEL 
             I know. It’ll be alright. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - EVENING 

On the steps, Daniel stares at the sun as it sets over the  
ancient city. Should he run? He watches for a long time. He  
looks down the street towards freedom. He looks back at the  
Fortress. With a heavy sigh, he turns and goes back inside. 

------------------91---------------

                                                                    9900.. 

INT. DANIEL 'S QUARTERS - EVENING 

Daniel slowly unpacks his belongings. He sits on the bed roll  
on the floor. Thinks. Resigns himself to his fate.  

INT. FORTRESS ANTONIA, LONGINUS’S QUARTERS - EVENING 

Longinus, in a simple tunic, eats after his long march.  
Another SERVING ATTENDANT looks after his armor while a GUARD  
stands at the doorway.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Come! 

Daniel enters solemnly.  

                         DANIEL 
             Tribune. 

Longinus continues eating.  

Daniel steels himself. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             The prisoner, Tribune. The boy... 

                         LONGINUS 
             The spy. 

                         DANIEL 
            What is to become of him? 

                         LONGINUS 
                  (to the others) 
             Leave us. 

The Attendant and Guard exit. 

Longinus doesn’t look at Daniel. He is emotionless. Tired?  
Or...something else? 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             He’ll be questioned further and  
             then executed.  

There is a long, tense silence. 

                         DANIEL 
             Tribune, I know the boy. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Yes. He said he knew you. Thought  
             it might help his case.  

------------------92---------------

                                                                    9911.. 

                         DANIEL 
             I saw the bruises. 

Longinus is as sad as he is angry.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Daniel...did you betray me? 

Another long silence. 

                         DANIEL 
            Yes, Tribune. 

Longinus hangs his head in regret, disappointment, and anger. 

                         LONGINUS 
            You ate my food. You enjoyed the  
            protection of my roof. You stole my  
            trust... 

                         DANIEL 
            No, Tribune... 

                         LONGINUS 
             ...Nothing more than a common  
            thief... 

                         DANIEL 
             Tribune, please... 

                         LONGINUS 
             I trusted you... 

                         DANIEL 
             I had no... 

                         LONGINUS 
             I considered you a friend.  Guard! 

Daniel understands the betrayal is even deeper than he  
thought. 

                         DANIEL 
                  (growing desperate) 
             Tribune, the boy is nothing. He  
            knows nothing... 

                         LONGINUS 
            He has raised his hand against  
            Rome. You! You have raised your  
            hand against Rome. Against me. 

------------------93---------------

                                                                    9922.. 

                         DANIEL 
             Rome killed his father! He is  
            young, stupid. His death will do  
             nothing but anger the  
             people...spare him. 

                         LONGINUS 
             I will have you both executed.  

                         DANIEL 
             Take me, Tribune. Let the boy go.  
             He is all that is left to his  
            mother. Rome has already made her a  
            widow and the boy fatherless. Take  
            my life instead.  

                         LONGINUS 
            What is this boy to you? 

Daniel squirms under Longinus’s glare. 

                         DANIEL 
             His mother...she is a friend. 

                         LONGINUS 
            A “friend?” 

                         DANIEL 
            More than a friend, Tribune. 

Longinus is silent. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Please, spare his life and... 

                         LONGINUS 
             How dare you ask any favor of me!  
            Why shouldn’t I just torture the  
             details from the boy? 

An intense stand off.  

                         DANIEL 
             Tribune. I beg you. Send the boy  
             back to his mother and I will take  
            you to the ring leaders this very  
            moment.   

Longinus is torn. 

------------------94---------------

                                                                    9933.. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, STREETS - DAY 

Thirty Legionnaires quick-time through the streets. Longinus  
follows on horseback. Daniel and Zachary are tied, guarded  
and run behind. Frightened people scatter as the Soldiers  
march determinedly on.  

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE MOUNT - DAY 

The Temple Mount is buzzing with activity. Caleb sits on his  
worn blanket begging. 

                         CALEB 
             Spare a coin and save your soul... 

PEOPLE rush by in front of him. 

                         VOICE #1 O.C. 
             Master, why was this man born  
             blind?  

The Crowd closes in around Caleb. Caleb grows nervous. 

                         VOICE #2 O.C. 
            Who sinned? This beggar or his  
             parents?  

                         CALEB 
             I am no sinner! 

Jesus’s voice is heard in the crowd. He laughs  
sympathetically. 

                         JESUS O.C. 
             No? You did not sin? 

                         CALEB 
                  (emphatic) 
             No. 

                         JESUS O.C. 
                  (to the crowd) 
            And, neither did his parents. What  
             is your name? 

                         CALEB 
                  (anxious) 
             Me? You’re talking to me? 

                         JESUS O.C. 
             Yes, my blind friend.

                         CALEB 
            Caleb.  

                         JESUS O.C. 
            Caleb. 

Recognition dawns on Caleb. 

                         CALEB 
             I’ve heard you preach.  You’re  
            better than most.  

                         JESUS O.C. 
            Thank you.  

                         CALEB 
             I’m not a sinner. I follow the law  
            of Moses and wait for the Messiah.  

                         JESUS O.C. 
                  (to Caleb) 
            Well...your wait is over. 
                  (to disciples) 
            Caleb was born blind so that the  
            power of God can be shown through  
            him.  

Jesus kneels down into frame. He spits on the ground. With a  
knowing grin, he works the spit and dirt and makes a little  
ball of mud. 

                         JESUS 
            Caleb, can you make your way to the  
            pool of Siloam? You know where it  
             is? 

                         CALEB 
            Why? 

Jesus reaches towards Caleb’s face. 

EXT. SECRET MEETING PLACE - DAY 

Daniel and Zachary wait behind the Soldiers as Longinus gives  
the signal to proceed. The Legionnaires charge up the stairs. 

INT. SECRET MEETING PLACE - SAME 

The Soldiers break through the door. Barabbas and others  
scramble away.  

------------------96---------------

                                                                    9955.. 

A Soldier grabs Barabbas. Barabbas draws a long dagger and  
stabs the Soldier just above his protective armor. The  
Soldier collapses as another takes his place.  

Barabbas thrusts and jabs with skill, but the Soldier is more  
skilled and soon disarms him. 

EXT. SECRET MEETING PLACE - LATER 

Barabbas is bound and gagged. He’s dragged off to the  
Fortress. Daniel urges Longinus on. 

                         DANIEL 
            We have to hurry. Word will spread  
             quickly. 

INT. JAAKOB’S TANNERY - LATER 

Jaakob hurriedly gathers a bedroll, tunic, food stuffs and a  
short sword. He is shocked when he hears a voice outside.  

                         ZACHARY O.C. 
             Jaakob! Jaakob! I’m back! Hurry! 

Jaakob runs angrily towards the door. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Where have you been... 

EXT. JAAKOB'S TANNERY - SAME 

Zachary stands waiting nervously as Jaakob rushes out. 

                         JAAKOB 
             ...you worthless... 

Jaakob sees Daniel standing beside Zachary. He stops,  
shocked. 

Three Legionnaires reveal themselves. Jaakob bolts towards a  
side street, but is met across the head by the spear shaft of  
a Legionnaire. Jaakob collapses in a heap. 

EXT. JAAKOB'S TANNERY - LATER 

The Soldiers are turning out all of Jaakob’s possessions,  
tools, etc., and dumping them in the street. Jaakob is bound  
and still groggy.  Longinus talks to Zachary. 

------------------97---------------

                                                                    9966.. 

                         LONGINUS  
            Any further problems, and nothing  
            will save you.  

Zachary doesn’t even look up. 

                         DANIEL 
             Zachary. Go home.  

                         ZACHARY 
            What now? What happens to you? 

                         DANIEL 
            Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.  

Daniel pulls out a familiar, small leather pouch. Gives it to  
Zachary.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Take care of your mother. Tell  
            her... 

Daniel wants to tell what is in his heart, but... 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             ...tell her to take care of Caleb.  

                         ZACHARY 
            But, what... 

                         DANIEL 
            No more. Go. Now. 

Teary-eyed, Zachary runs.  

Soldiers approach Daniel and place manacles on his wrists. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Thank you, Tribune. For what it’s  
            worth, I am truly sorry. 

                         LONGINUS 
            As am I. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, STREETS - DAY 

The usual crowds go about their business.  

                         CALEB O.C. 
            He is a prophet!!!!! 

People turn towards the yelling voice. 

------------------98---------------

                                                                    9977.. 

Caleb exults; running full speed and carrying his crutch. 

                         CALEB 
             I can see! I can run! 

He spins a startled SHEPHERD. Caleb throws his crutch away. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             I CAN SEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! 

Caleb keeps running. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! 

EXT. CHAVA AND SILAS’S HOME - DAY 

Breathless and tear-stained face, Zachary runs to his home. 

                         ZACHARY 
            Mother! Mother! 

He bolts inside. Tense moments pass.  

                         CHAVA O.C. 
            No...no...NO!!! NO!!! 

Crying, angry, afraid, desperate, Chava runs from her home  
followed by a devastated Zachary. He leans against the gate  
and weeps.  Chava runs into the city. 

INT. CHAVA’S HOME - SAME 

On the table...the leather pouch, coins spilled. There,  
amongst the spilled coins...two pearl ear rings. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, MARKETPLACE - LATER 

Frantic, Chava searches for Daniel at the Marketplace where  
Caleb often begs. She calls out. 

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel!! Daniel! Caleb!  

The crowd ignores her as they gather around another more  
compelling figure. 

Caleb recounts his miracle to a growing crowd--many confused,  
others joyous, others skeptical.  

------------------99---------------

                                                                    9988.. 

                         CALEB 
             ...washed in the pool and I see! 

Caleb is amazed at his new world and recognizes many people  
he’s only known by their voice. AVRAM, a baker... 

                         AVRAM 
             Caleb! But, who did this?? 

Caleb narrows his gaze... 

                         CALEB 
             The baker...Avram! 

He pulls Avram into an embrace. 

                         AVRAM 
             Yes! 

                         CALEB 
             Jesus. The rabbi from Galilee.  

As Caleb recognizes others, Chava pushes through the crowd.  
She can’t believe her eyes. 

                         CHAVA 
             Caleb??? 

Caleb quickly turns. His eyes widen. 

                         CALEB 
             Chava...Chava... Chava!! 

He throws his arms around her.  

                         CHAVA 
             Caleb?? How is this possible?? 

                         CALEB 
             The Messiah is come. 

Chava is stunned. 

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
             Chava, where is Daniel? I must find  
             him. Have you seen him? 

Chava collapses in tears against Caleb.  

INT. PRAETORIUM, CELLS - NIGHT 

Dark, dank, filthy. Dry stone walls and iron bars. Several  
PRISONERS, lives and hope spent, inhabit adjacent cells.  

------------------100---------------

                                                                    9999.. 

Daniel, Jaakob, and Barabbas sit in a cell that fronts a  
stone court. Jutting from the stained floor of the court, a  
stone pillory with chains stands ominously near their cell’s  
iron grate wall.  

                         JAAKOB 
             I hope they kill you first. At  
             least I’ll get to watch you suffer.  

Daniel doesn’t respond. The injured Barabbas watches  
indifferently. 

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            You. You did this.  

Daniel turns his back to Jaakob.  

Incensed, Jaakob attacks Daniel.  

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Now we’re going to die because of  
            you! 

The years of injustice, disappointment and failure rise up in  
Daniel and rain down on Jaakob. Daniel gives Jaakob the  
beating he’s deserved for decades. 

                         DANIEL 
            You did this to yourself.  

The Prisoners cheer on the fight, yelling at Daniel to kill  
the now beaten Jaakob. Fueled by rage and adrenaline, Daniel  
...stops himself.  He throws Jaakob to the floor. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             It’s more fitting that the Romans  
            kill you.  

The emotion and adrenaline well up in Daniel. He fights back  
tears. He leaves the bloodied Jaakob on the floor. 

EXT. FORTRESS ANTONIA - DAY 

The usual crowds mill in front of the Fortress.  Chava and  
Caleb rush up to the GUARDS. 

                         CHAVA 
            We’re looking for Daniel. 

                         CALEB 
            Daniel. One of the Tribune’s  
             attendants.  

------------------101---------------

                                                                   110000.. 

The Guards push them aside as the gates open. 

                         GUARD 
             Clear away! Move! 

Longinus, on horseback, leads a dozen SOLDIERS through the  
crowd. Chava and Caleb call to him but are lost in the noise  
and confusion.   

                         CALEB 
             Go home. I’ll follow them and find  
             a way to talk to the Tribune. 

                         CHAVA 
             But...what do we do? 

                         CALEB 
             Pray. Go home. I’ll find you. 

Chava hugs Caleb and hurries off. Caleb follows Longinus. 

EXT. JERUSALEM, TEMPLE MOUNT - DAY 

Longinus and his Soldiers arrive at a disorganized and  
chaotic scene. Tables overturned, MONEY CHANGERS yelling,  
Pharisees arguing. Longinus dismounts. The Pharisees spot him  
and march right up. Soldiers react defensively. 

                         PHARISEE #1 
             This madman ran through the court.  
             Throwing over tables. Breaking open  
             cages. Chasing our Money Changers. 

The angry Money Changers and Others gather round. 

                         LONGINUS 
            Why?  

                         PHARISEE #2 
             He was yelling about his father’s  
             house and calling these innocent  
            merchants, “thieves!” 

                         PHARISEE #3 
             He’s a dangerous lunatic. 

                         CALEB O.C. 
             He’s the Messiah! 

Caleb has caught up and pushes through the large crowd. A few  
people in the crowd recognize Caleb. They are shocked. 

------------------102---------------

                                                                   110011.. 

           PHARISEE #2                            PHARISEE #3 
Blasphemy!                             How dare you?! 

                         PHARISEE #1 
            Who are... 

Pharisee #1. Stares at Caleb. He steps closer. 

                         PHARISEE #1 (CONT’D) 
             You...you’re...you’re the beggar.  
             The blind beggar who sits here in  
             the court. 

All the Pharisees look closely.  

                         PHARISEE #3 
             How is this possible? 

                         CALEB 
             He healed me. 

                         PHARISEE #3 
            Who? 

                         CALEB 
             Jesus. The Messiah. 

The crowd reacts to the word, “Messiah.” 

                         PHARISEE #1 
             Say that again and I’ll have you  
             stoned! 

Longinus has had enough. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Stop! You barking hyenas. Only Rome  
             has the power of life and death.  
                  (to Caleb) 
             Your name. 

                         CALEB 
             Caleb, Tribune.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Explain yourself. 

                         CALEB 
             Jesus. He placed mud on my eyes and  
             told me to wash in the pool of  
             Siloam.  

                         LONGINUS 
            And... 

------------------103---------------

                                                                   110022.. 

                         CALEB 
             I did so. And as the mud washed  
             away... I can see.   

                         PHARISEE #2 
            He’s a liar. 

                         PHARISEE #3 
            He’s been pretending all along. You  
            were never blind.  

                         CALEB 
            You are blind. All of you. 

                         PHARISEE #3 
            You see, Tribune? His followers are  
             deranged.  

Longinus considers Caleb’s words carefully.  

                         LONGINUS 
            And Jesus did this miracle? 

                         CALEB 
            Yes, Tribune. Jesus. 

                         PHARISEE #1 
            What if the nonsense of these  
             “miracles” spreads? What if the  
            people believe anyone at all can  
             come into the temple and do...  
            this???  Who knows where this will  
             end? 

                         PHARISEE #2 
             The people will be ungovernable.  

                         PHARISEE #3 
            How long before they refuse to obey  
            Rome? 

                         PHARISEE #1 
             They’ll all be as crazy as this  
             one. 

                         CALEB 
             I was crippled and now I walk. I  
            was blind and now I see.  

Caleb’s words leave Longinus confounded.  

                         CALEB (CONT’D) 
            And it was Jesus who did it. 

------------------104---------------

                                                                   110033.. 

Pharisee #3 lunges towards Caleb. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Centurions! 

Longinus’s Troops separate Caleb from the angered Pharisees.  

The crowd has grown restless and noisy.  

He motions to his Troops. They push Caleb and the crowd back. 

Longinus rides his horse back towards the Fortress. The  
Soldiers fall back and cover the return.  

                         CALEB 
             Tribune! I must speak with you. 

Longinus is beyond ear shot. Caleb follows after. 

A handsome, dark-haired man approaches the Pharisees--JUDAS.  

                         JUDAS 
             I overheard your “discussion.” 

                         PHARISEE #1 
            You’re one of his followers. I’ve  
             seen you.  

                         PHARISEE #2 
            Who are you? 

                         JUDAS 
             Judas. Judas Iscariot.  

EXT. JERUSALEM SKYLINE - SUNSET 

The sun drops below the horizon signaling the beginning of  
the Passover.  

EXT. GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE - NIGHT 

Outside of the garden wall, a large crowd gathers carrying  
torches, staffs, and clubs. TEMPLE GUARDS carry spears.  
Pharisees #1, #2, and #3 organize the anxious group. Judas  
Iscariot joins them. 

Judas motions for the Pharisees to give him something.  
Pharisee #2 hands Judas a small leather bag. Judas opens it  
and inspects several silver coins.  

Judas disappears into the Garden.

EXT. JERUSALEM, STREETS - SAME 

Down the road from the Garden and the growing crowd, Longinus  
and a band of Soldiers waits in hiding. Longinus wears simple  
clothing and a hooded cloak--not his uniform.  

                         LONGINUS 
             Do not move unless I send word.  
             We’ll leave this to the Jews unless  
             it gets out of hand.  

                         SOLDIER 
             We await your command, Tribune. 

Longinus walks towards the crowd at the wall. He dons the  
hood to keep from being recognized. 

EXT. GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE - SAME 

Inside the gated entrance, the crowd pushes forward led by  
the Pharisees and Judas. The hooded Longinus blends into the  
rear of the crowd. 

Jesus approaches, supported by PETER, 40’s, stout, volatile,  
and JOHN, 30’s, loyal. The other DISCIPLES follow behind.  

Jesus is exhausted. His hair and robes are matted with blood.  
His face and hands have been wiped but still bare traces of  
brutal hours in Gethsemane.  

The crowd confronts Jesus and his DISCIPLES.  

                         JESUS 
             Who are you looking for? 

The Temple Guards, confident a moment ago, now shrink back.  

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             Jesus? 

Judas approaches Jesus and kisses him on the cheek. 

                         JUDAS 
             Master.  

                         JESUS 
             Judas. You betray me with a kiss.  

Peter reacts at the word “betray.” 

At the signal of the kiss, the Temple Guards and others move  
forward to take Jesus.  

------------------106---------------

                                                                   110055.. 

Longinus watches from the rear, pushing his way forward. 

An angry Peter draws his sword and charges between Jesus and  
the Guards.  Peter swings at a nearby mob member, MALCHUS,  
cutting off his ear. Peter presses home the attack. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
            PETER! 

The commanding voice stops Peter in his tracks. The crowd  
falls back. Jesus straightens, his strength and bearing  
renewed. Malchus writhes in pain. His ear is missing.  

Longinus reacts to the injured Malchus. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
            Peter, put away your sword.  

                         PETER 
            Run!  

                         JESUS 
            No. Peter. Live by the sword, you  
            will die by it.  

Grudgingly, Peter stands down. Jesus looks over the crowd. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             I was with you in the temple every  
             day. Why didn’t you take me then?  
            But, now, in the middle of the  
             night? Am I a criminal? 

Jesus turns toward the suffering Malchus. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
            What’s your name?  

                         MALCHUS 
                  (pain) 
            Malchus. 

Longinus watches as Jesus raises Malchus. 

Jesus helps the struggling Malchus to his feet. As he stands,  
the pain ceases. He feels his injured ear--healed. Nervously,  
he looks at Jesus who smiles. 

Longinus can’t believe what he’s just seen--a miracle! 

Pharisee #1 pushes forward. 

                         PHARISEE #1 
             Take him! 

------------------107---------------

                                                                   110066.. 

The Temple Guards hesitate. Jesus offers up his hands.  

                         JESUS 
             It’s alright. 

                         PHARISEE #1 
             Do it! 

Nervous Guards bind Jesus and force him to the entrance. 

EXT. GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE - NIGHT 

The angry crowd yells and jeers as they push Jesus down the  
street away from the gated garden.  

EXT. GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE - SAME 

Back in the Garden, Longinus looks over the scene of the  
recent events. He pulls his hood back. Peter, John, and the  
other Disciples recognize him. They flee.  

Longinus looks at the ground. Finds blood where Malchus lay.  
He now has more questions than answers. 

INT. GOVERNOR’S PALACE - MORNING 

A sparse, yet regal antechamber in the palace of the  
procurator. A crowd is heard chanting, “Barabbas, Barabbas,  
Barabbas!” A purple curtain is flung open and a frustrated  
PONTIUS PILATE storms into the antechamber. He is followed by  
two ADVISORS, Longinus, and his Optio.  

                         PILATE 
             I do not understand these people! 

An AIDE scurries to the agitated Pilate. 

                         PILATE (CONT’D) 
            Wine. Immediately. 

The Aide genuflects and hurries away.  

                         PILATE (CONT’D) 
             The man is innocent! Anyone can see  
             that!  

                         LONGINUS 
             The Sanhedrin appears unyielding.  

------------------108---------------

                                                                   110077.. 

                         PILATE 
            The Sanhedrin accuses me of  
            disloyalty to Caesar, that raving  
            mob out there threatens me as an  
             idolatrous infidel...even my wife  
            troubles me with her dreams about  
            this man! 

The Aide returns with wine. Pilate drinks it gratefully. He  
calms himself. 

                         PILATE (CONT’D) 
            Your advice, Tribune. 

The Optio glances warily at Longinus. 

                         LONGINUS 
             I would not presume to give advice  
            to the Procurator.  

                         PILATE 
            Please, I’m already surrounded by  
             fawners and sycophants. Longinus.  
            What would you do? 

                         LONGINUS 
             I share your confusion, Governor. I  
            know he is capable of arousing  
            great passion in his followers. A  
            week ago they called him, “King.”  
            He’s never struck down one of my  
             soldiers, or cursed you or the  
            Emperor. He tells them to treat  
            each other with love and kindness  
             and, yet, he ransacks their temple  
            courtyard and chases away their  
            money changers. All of those  
            braying jackasses who clamor for  
            his death saw him heal that  
             servant’s ear just a few hours ago.  
             I saw it. I was there.  

                         PILATE 
            You saw it? 

                         LONGINUS 
            Yes.  

                         PILATE 
            Tell me. 

------------------109---------------

                                                                   110088.. 

                         LONGINUS 
            The Hebrew leaders gathered a force  
            of zealots and temple guards to  
            take him; a large, angry mob. But,  
            when he identified himself, they  
            were overwhelmed. They fell back.  
            He actually had to tell them to  
            take him into custody.   

Longinus is only now really processing what he’s experienced. 

                         PILATE 
            He’s the same way here. He should  
            be terrified, but he’s in total  
            control of himself.  

                         LONGINUS 
            Before they can arrest him, one of  
            his followers draws a sword and  
            hacks off the ear of the High  
            Priest’s servant. In the confusion,  
            he doesn’t run, he doesn’t fuel the  
             fire...he commands his follower to  
            put away his sword. 

Longinus is realizing that there is much more to this Jesus  
than a simple street preacher. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
            He could’ve easily escaped,  
            Governor. But, he didn’t.  

                         PILATE 
            You see my dilemma.  

                         LONGINUS 
             I’ve seen many prophets during my  
             service in Judea. None like this  
            one. 

                         PILATE 
            He’s so calm...it’s unnerving. With  
            his life in my hands, he is  
             fearless. Disdainful, even, of  
            Rome.  

Unspoken, Pilate admires Jesus. 

                         PILATE (CONT’D) 
            Caiaphas. The Sanhedrin...they are  
            relentless.  

                         LONGINUS 
            They envy him.  

------------------110---------------

                                                                   110099.. 

                         PILATE 
            They fear him.  

Pilate drinks. 

                         PILATE (CONT’D) 
            And now they want this seditious  
            murderer released. A man who can  
            heal people; and they want the  
            murderer.  

                         LONGINUS 
             I do worry about the crowd. Their  
            holiday. Thousands of pilgrims  
            whipped into a frenzy by their  
            priests. I do not fear this  
            preacher. I fear the priests.  

Pilate sits. He nurses his drink and his head.  

                         PILATE 
             I do not understand them. 

Pilate closes his eyes and rubs his temples.  

                         PILATE (CONT’D) 
             It’s on their heads. Not mine. 

INT. PRAETORIUM, CELLS - EARLY MORNING 

Daniel sits, hands around his knees, back against the iron  
grate. He hasn’t slept. Roman Soldiers throw open the  
entrance to the court and roughly push Jesus to the floor. He  
crashes against the iron grate where Daniel sits. 

Daniel, Jaakob, and Barabbas watch.  

                         JAAKOB 
             It’s that street preacher. 

Jesus painfully pulls himself up and sits against the grate,  
his back to Daniel. 

                         BARABBAS 
            What about a miracle now, eh? 

Jesus doesn’t react. 

                         BARABBAS (CONT’D) 
             I could use some wine about now. 

------------------111---------------

                                                                   111100.. 

                         JAAKOB 
            Wine? I want an easy miracle. Just  
             get us out of here.  

Daniel watches; not sure what to make of Jesus. 

Jesus doesn’t respond to Jaakob’s taunting. 

Daniel watches Jaakob, then Jesus. 

                         DANIEL 
             I saw you preach once.  

Daniel turns away, his back to Jesus.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             It was the first time I ever heard  
             anyone say anything good about a  
             Samaritan. 

Jesus is quiet. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Why are you here, preacher? 

Jesus takes his time answering. 

                         JESUS 
             Sedition, blasphemy...anything they  
            could think of. 

                         DANIEL 
             So, you’re innocent. Like everyone  
            else in here. 

                         JESUS 
            Yes, I am.  

Daniel shakes his head. 

The Soldiers open the door to Daniel’s cell. 

                         SOLDIER 
            Barabbas! Who is Barabbas? 

Prisoners shy away from Barabbas. A PRISONER points at him. 

                         PRISONER 
            He’s Barabbas. 

The Soldiers drag Barabbas to his feet.  

------------------112---------------

                                                                   111111.. 

                         SOLDIER 
            By order of the Governor Pontius  
            Pilate, the prisoner Barabbas is  
             freed as a gesture of good will on  
            the Jewish festival from the  
            Emperor to his Judean subjects.  

Jaakob is stunned.  

                         JAAKOB 
            What?! No! He killed a Legionnaire! 

The Soldiers manhandle Barabbas. 

                         SOLDIER 
             If I had my way, I’d gut you here  
             and now. 

                         JAAKOB 
            No! What about me?? I didn’t kill  
             anybody! 

The Soldier shoves Jaakob back. 

                         SOLDIER 
            We’ll be right back for you. You  
             and that other traitorous filth,  
            will die today with that “holy  
            man.”  

Daniel now knows his fate.  

Barabbas manages a self-satisfied smile. 

                         BARABBAS 
            Goodbye, Jaakob. 

                         JAAKOB 
            No!!! 

Jaakob rushes the Soldiers and the doorway. He is beaten  
back. The Soldiers take Barabbas away.  

Jaakob rushes Jesus.   

                         JAAKOB (CONT’D) 
            Do something! If you’re the  
            Messiah, the Messiah would destroy  
            this prison and the Romans! 

Daniel shoves him back.  

                         DANIEL 
             Stop! Jaakob!  

------------------113---------------

                                                                   111122.. 

                         JAAKOB 
            You know what they are going to do  
            to us?! 

                         DANIEL 
            Jaakob... 

                         JAAKOB 
            You know! You’ve seen crucifixion!  
            After all your groveling and  
             scraping, they are going to crucify  
            you! 

                         DANIEL 
            Yes! They are. Not because I worked  
             for them. But because I betrayed  
            them. Because of you.  

Daniel shoves the irrational Jaakob to the corner. 

Daniel looks around at his surroundings. He tries to calm the  
fear welling up inside him. He slumps against the iron grate.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I don’t want to die.  

                         JESUS 
             I know. I don’t either.  

                         DANIEL 
            Why? Why is this happening?  

Jesus listens.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             I tried. I really did. Now,  
            everything is gone.  Caleb,  
            Chava...my Mother.  

Daniel becomes resigned as Jesus listens. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            Now I’m going to die. Was  
            everything a waste? Where was God?  

The rising sun peeks through the barred windows in the jail. 

Daniel despairs and looks towards heaven.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
                  (whispered) 
            Where are you? 

Jesus raises a hand to his eyes and begins to speak.

                         JESUS 
             She-ma yisrael, Adonai eloheinu,  
            Adonai echad. Blessed is the name  
            of His glorious kingdom for ever  
             and ever...  

Daniel begins to follow Jesus and recite the words of the  
prayer his mother taught him long ago.  

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             ...You shall love the Lord your God  
            with all your heart with all your  
             soul and with all your might... 

                         DANIEL 
            My mother recited the Shema  
            everyday. 

                         JESUS 
            You had a good mother.  

                         DANIEL 
            Why did she have to die? Mary and  
            Joseph? Chava...it all meant  
            nothing. 

                         JESUS 
            What about the crutch you made for  
            Caleb? You were a kind friend to  
             Zachary. More than that you saved  
            his life. You gave Chava hope.  

Daniel looks with confusion.  

                         DANIEL 
            How did you know about that? About  
            Caleb and Chava? 

                         JESUS 
            Because you have never been alone.  
            God has seen everything. He has  
             always been with you.  

Daniel turns towards Jesus and looks at him through the iron  
grate. Daniel is trying to absorb everything Jesus is saying. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
            Your whole life has led you here.  
            And my whole life has led me here  
            to be with you. He sent me to be  
            with you now and I am with you  
             always even to the end.  

Daniel stares intently at Jesus. 

------------------115---------------

                                                                   111144.. 

                         DANIEL 
            Who are you? 

                         JESUS 
            Will you believe? 

                         DANIEL 
             I want to believe. 

                         JESUS 
             Even as a grain of mustard seed.  
             That is enough. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             You sacrificed your life to save  
             Zachary. There is no greater love.  
            What I do today changes everything  
             for you. For everyone.  

Jesus’s words calm Daniel.  

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             Your mother is proud.  

Now looking at Jesus, Daniel sees, hanging around his  
neck...on a thin, braided leather cord, the ring...his  
mother’s ring. 

Just then, Roman Guards open the door and march to Jesus.  

Jesus takes the cord and the ring from over his head. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             “And I...will refine them as silver  
             is refined, and will try them as  
             gold is tried...I have chosen thee  
             in the furnace of affliction...and  
             shall sit as a refiner of silver...  
             that they may offer unto the Lord  
             an offering in righteousness.” 

Jesus faces Daniel and reaches through the bars. He gently  
places the ring in Daniel’s hands. 

All the pieces fall together. Daniel knows it’s the baby in  
Bethlehem, the Rabbi from the street, and now he knows this  
man is so much more! 

                         DANIEL 
                  (recognition) 
             Jesus? Jesus! 

------------------116---------------

                                                                   111155.. 

                         JESUS 
             If you believe in me, even though  
            you will die, you will live: And  
            whoever lives and believes in me  
            will never die. 

The Guards slam Jesus against the grate, face towards Daniel.  

Preparing to scourge Jesus, the Guards tear his robe from his  
shoulders.  

                         DANIEL 
            Rabboni! 

The Guards drag Jesus to the pillory and tie him to it.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             STOP!!! You can’t do this!!!  

Daniel realizes fully, he fights against the grate. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
            He is the Messiah! 

Jesus offers a peaceful smile to Daniel as the lash falls. 

EXT. PRAETORIUM - MORNING 

Longinus waits next to his horse with a contingent of  
Legionnaires near the entrance to the Roman Fortress. A small  
crowd, including Chava, Caleb, and Mary has gathered by the  
entrance. Chava approaches Longinus. 

                         CHAVA 
            Tribune, where is your attendant,  
            Daniel? 

                         LONGINUS 
            What is he to you? 

Chava searches for the right words. 

                         CHAVA 
            He was only trying to save my son. 

Longinus realizes who this is. Chava is overcome and can’t  
finish the sentence. 

                         LONGINUS 
                  (sympathetic) 
            He stole my trust as well.  

------------------117---------------

                                                                   111166.. 

A woodcutter’s wagon reins to a stop. Two WOODCUTTERS climb  
down and throw three heavy, eight-foot cross pieces off the  
wagon in front of the entrance. They climb back on the wagon  
and drive on with a load of three 20-foot beams.  

Longinus nods to Soldiers at the entrance. They open the gate  
to the Praetorium. The other Soldiers hold back the crowd.  

Daniel and Jaakob are pushed out into the street.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
                  (painful) 
             Here he is now. 

                         CHAVA 
             Daniel!!! 

Chava rushes through the Soldiers. Caleb follows. She throws  
her arms around Daniel. 

Soldiers rush to separate them. Longinus steps up. 

                         LONGINUS 
             Leave them be. 

Daniel looks up with gratitude. 

                         DANIEL 
             Tribune.  

                         CHAVA 
             Tell me this isn’t happening!  
             Please! 

The badly beaten Jesus follows.  

                         DANIEL 
             It’s over.  

                         CALEB 
             Daniel.  

Even in such distress, Daniel is shocked seeing Caleb.  

                         DANIEL 
             Caleb??? How is this possible? 

Caleb indicates Jesus. Who is surrounded by Mary and other  
WOMEN. 

                         CALEB 
             He healed me.  

------------------118---------------

                                                                   111177.. 

                         DANIEL 
             It’s Him.  It’s Him! 

                         CALEB 
            Yes. Yes, it is.  

                         JAAKOB 
            Chava, have you t... 

Chava slaps Jaakob hard. She turns her back to him. 

Caleb implores Longinus. 

                         CALEB 
            Tribune, I beg of you don’t let  
            this happen. 

                         LONGINUS 
            My hands are tied.  

                         DANIEL 
             It’s not his fault, Caleb. 

Daniel holds Chava’s face in his hands. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Is Zachary alright? 

                         CHAVA 
            Yes. Yes. He’s worried for you. 

Daniel takes the ring on the cord and hands it to Chava. 

                         DANIEL 
            Give this to Zachary.  

Chava gasps. She can’t believe it.  

                         CHAVA 
            What? How did you get this? 

                         DANIEL 
                  (pointing to Jesus) 
            He’s the baby from Bethlehem. 

                         CHAVA 
            The preacher??!! 

                         DANIEL 
            The Messiah. Take care of Zachary.  
            And Caleb. 

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel? They can’t take you! 

------------------119---------------

                                                                   111188.. 

Chava weeps in Daniel’s arms. Caleb watches in sadness.  

Hearing the women weeping, the bloodied Jesus speaks. 

                         JESUS 
             Daughters of Jerusalem, weep for  
             yourselves and for your children.  

Longinus speaks up. 

                         LONGINUS 
            We must go. 

Chava weeps more bitterly.  

                         DANIEL 
             Chava. Go. You will be alright. 

Chava refuses to let go. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Caleb. Caleb. Take care of her.  

Reluctantly, Caleb helps Chava pull away. 

Daniel holds Chava’s outstretched hand and kisses it. 

Soldiers separate Daniel from his friends. 

                         SOLDIER 
             Pick it up! 

Daniel hefts the heavy cross piece. 

                         JAAKOB 
             It’s too heavy! 

A Soldier cracks a whip across Jaakob’s back.  He yells in  
pain and struggles to raise the timber.  

Soldiers force the crying Mary from Jesus pushing her to the  
ground.  Longinus steps in.  

                         LONGINUS 
             That’s enough, Legionnaire.  

Longinus helps Mary to her feet. Her eyes plead with him. He  
moves on, reluctantly. Longinus knows this is wrong. He is  
caught between what his heart is telling him and his duty.  

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
                  (quietly) 
             There is nothing I can do! 

------------------120---------------

                                                                   111199.. 

Jesus picks up his cross and falls in with Daniel and Jaakob.  
Soldiers hold back the crowd. 

They begin the long trek to Golgotha. 

EXT. GOLGOTHA - DAY 

A raised knob of dry earth outside the walls of Jerusalem.   
The Woodcutter’s wagon sits near the crest. Three long  
timbers lay on the ground next to three deep holes. The  
Woodcutters prepare them to receive the cross pieces. 

SIMON, the Cyrene, having been forced to carry the crossbeam,  
drops his heavy load and collapses on his knees next to it. A  
listless Jesus falls next to him. 

A Legionnaire shoves Simon brusquely. 

                         LEGIONNAIRE 
            Go! You dog! 

Simon faces Jesus. 

                         JESUS 
                  (hoarse) 
             Thank you, Simon. 

Simon can say nothing. The Legionnaire becomes more violent. 

                         LEGIONNAIRE 
            Be gone or I’ll nail you next to  
            him. 

With tears, Simon limps away. 

Jaakob drags his cross piece. A Roman Soldier shoves him and  
he tumbles to the ground sobbing. 

Daniel drops his cross piece as well. Physically less damaged  
than Jesus, and more stoic compared to Jaakob, Daniel  
breathes heavily.  

Soldiers hold the crowd back as Longinus rides up. He  
reluctantly presides over the execution. 

Chava and Caleb fight to be near the front.  

                         CHAVA 
            Daniel! Daniel! 

Daniel sees her. He manages a weak smile. She cries. Caleb  
tries to console her. 

------------------121---------------

                                                                   112200.. 

Mary and a few Disciples kneel in front of the Soldiers who  
restrain the crowd.   

A Legionnaire pulls a bulky hammer and several long spikes  
from the back of the wagon. Another holds a coil of rope.  

                         LEGIONNAIRE 
            Rope, or nails?  

                         LEGIONNAIRE #2 
             Tie them. They deserve to suffer as  
             long as possible.  

Longinus interrupts. 

                         LONGINUS 
             I want this over with. Nails.  

                         LEGIONNAIRE #2 
            Yes, Tribune. 

The crowd yells and rails at the convicts, goaded on by the  
Pharisees and High Priests that have joined the rabid crowd.  

Soldiers strip Daniel and Jaakob of their clothing. Jaakob  
writhes and screams as the Soldiers hold him down. We only  
see the arcing hammer as the spikes are driven. 

Daniel watches it all as if detached from the reality  
occurring around him.   

Soldiers hold Daniel. Swings of the hammer. Pain on his face.  

Chava reacts. Longinus stands over Daniel, sorrow and regret  
on his face. Daniel shakes his head. 

                         DANIEL 
             I’m sorry.  

Longinus can only nod his head and turn away. Something is  
happening inside Longinus. 

The Soldiers have done their work with Jesus. He is drained  
and in shock.   

                         JESUS 
             Father, forgive them. They don’t  
             know...  

Longinus is close enough to hear. Jesus’s forgiveness  
confuses him. A Legionnaire interrupts Longinus’s thoughts. 

                         LEGIONNAIRE 
             Tribune, the title. 

------------------122---------------

                                                                   112211.. 

The Legionnaire holds a placard that reads “King of the  
Jews.” One of the Pharisees sees it.  

                         PHARISEE #1 
            No! He isn’t King of the Jews! He  
             only said he was! 

                         LONGINUS 
                  (commanding) 
             It remains as Pilate dictates.  

Longinus nods to a Legionnaire who forces the offended  
Pharisee back into the crowd.  

The crosses with the three victims are raised and dropped  
into the three associated holes in the ground.  

The shock of the impact is seen on the faces of the crowd: 

Distraught Mary.  

Pained Chava and Caleb. 

The gloating Pharisees. 

DANIEL’S POV 

At the foot of the crosses, several Soldiers roll the dice  
for Jaakob’s clothing and Daniel’s tunic. They roll for  
Jesus’s robe.  

Longinus watches silently.  

EXT. GOLGOTHA - LATER 

The sun bears down on this wretched scene. 

Daniel breathes sporadically. Longinus watches from the foot  
of Daniel’s cross. He turns to his Soldiers 

                         LONGINUS 
             The wine. Give me the wine. 

The Legionnaires, surprised by Longinus’s actions, don’t  
move. Frustrated, Longinus grabs the bucket himself.   

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             The ladders...Move! 

A startled Legionnaire leans a ladder against Daniel’s cross.  
Two others do the same at the crosses of Jaakob and Jesus.

Longinus climbs the ladder and offers Daniel a sip of the  
drugged wine. A dazed Daniel drinks from the ladle. 

                         DANIEL 
                  (whispered) 
             Thank you. I’m sorry. 

Longinus can’t speak. 

Jesus refuses the pain-killing drink. 

Jaakob drinks greedily.  

The Crowd vents it’s venom. 

                         PHARISEE #2 
             If you are the Son of God, come  
             down off that cross! 

                         CROWD #1 
             Save yourself! 

The Crowd laughs and taunts. 

As Longinus and the Legionnaires descend the ladders,  
emboldened by the wine, Jaakob yells. 

                         JAAKOB 
             Yes! Yes, if you’re the Messiah, do  
             something! Save us!  

                         DANIEL 
             Quiet, Jaakob! We get what we  
             deserve. 

Daniel looks down at Longinus at the bottom of the ladder and  
holds his gaze. 

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             But...this man is innocent.  He has  
             done nothing wrong! 

Longinus knows Daniel is right. 

Daniel breathes heavily and then looks at Jesus.  

                         DANIEL (CONT’D) 
             Lord, remember me. 

Through the blood and dirt, Jesus smiles and assures Daniel. 

                         JESUS 
             Today...today, you will be with me  
             in Paradise.

                                                                   112233.. 

Daniel weeps, relieved of his life’s burden. 

EXT. GOLGOTHA - LATER 

Vultures circle above the crowd, the crosses, and the dying  
men. An ominous silence has settled over the grim scene. 

Jesus stirs. 

                         JESUS 
             I’m so thirsty. 

None of the Soldiers move. Seeing this, Longinus himself,  
again takes the bucket of wine and myrrh. He climbs the  
ladder against Jesus’s cross.  

Longinus carefully offers the ladle to Jesus. He drinks  
gratefully and responds with a hoarse whisper. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             Thank you. 

Longinus implores Jesus sincerely. 

                         LONGINUS 
            All those miracles...you can save  
             yourself. 
                  (pointing at Daniel) 
             Save him...save me. 

                         JESUS 
             I already have. 

DANIEL’S POV 

Daniel watches as Jesus speaks quietly to Longinus. Longinus  
bows his head and backs slowly down the ladder. 

After a few heavy breaths, Jesus looks directly at Daniel and  
smiles with relief. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             It is finished. 

Jesus looks up into the heavens. 

                         JESUS (CONT’D) 
             Father, into your hands I entrust  
            my spirit. 

He breathes one last drawn-out sigh...and dies.

EXT. GOLGOTHA - SAME 

The heavens darken. Daniel weeps. 

Mary sobs.  

Longinus stands at the foot of the cross contemplating the  
dead body.  

                         LONGINUS 
                  (grim realization) 
             Surely...This was the Son of God. 

Longinus steels himself for the final tasks. He marches to  
his men. 

                         LONGINUS (CONT’D) 
             Finish it! 

Two Legionnaires take wooden mallets in hand while others  
steady ladders against the two outside crosses. They climb up  
the ladders, mallets in hand.  

Determined, Longinus lifts a long spear and moves towards  
Jesus. 

Daniel watches, ready for the end.  

DANIEL’S POV 

Caleb holds Chava as she cries. Chava kisses the ring and  
holds it to her heart. Chava’s cries mix with another sound.  
Singing.  

In the b.g., the distant, distorted sounds of Jaakob’s scream  
and the visuals of Longinus piercing Jesus’s side fade. 

Daniel looks to find the source of the singing. The singing  
grows in strength as if sung by a choir.  

A dove flaps into frame, it’s fluttering wings flash through  
the sun.  

Daniel hears the song his mother sang to him as a child. The  
weakened Daniel begins to repeat the words. One voice rises  
above the rest; his mother’s voice. Daniel looks into heaven  
as the angelic choir swells.

EXT. SAMARIA, ROAD TO BETHLEHEM 

Back on the road to Bethlehem. Daniel, in a clean, neat  
tunic, stands looking around in bewilderment, echoes of the  
song still ringing in his head. A white dove flutters through  
the scene. He recognizes the place as the spot where his  
mother died. He turns and looks down the road. Leah stands.  
With a wide smile, she opens her arms.  

                                                                 CUT TO: 

INT. THE GARDEN TOMB - MORNING 

Inside, a figure wrapped in burial clothes. A white burial  
cloth covers the figure’s face. The camera slowly moves in. A  
sharp inward breath fills the lungs of the shrouded  
figure—the first breath of the resurrection.  

                                                         CUT TO BLACK:
